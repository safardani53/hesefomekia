Before I was in basketball, I was studying parallel studies in BTS management. It was complicated.”<br>-Ciryl Gane</p><p>Ciryl Gane was a two-time national Muay Thai champion before his involvement in the MMA. Apart from it, he is also an undefeated player of Muay Thai with a career record of 12-0.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ciryl-Gane-Posing.jpg><p>During that tenure, Gane met Fernand Lopez, who introduced and coached him for the MMA.

Now, I can finally say that I live from my sport and my job.”<br>-Ciryl Jane&nbsp;</p><h3>Ciryl Gane vs.&nbsp;Don’Tale Mayes</h3><p>On 26 October 2019, Ciryl Gane and Don’Tale Mayes provided quite an explosive clash at UFC Fight Night 162 in Singapore Indoor Stadium, Kallang, Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>The bout lasted till the third round, where Gane took the victory via a heel hook. All in all, the fight earned him a Performance of the Night bonus.</p><h3>Ciryl Gane vs.&nbsp;Tanner Boser</h3><p>Following his glorious streak, Ciryl Gane faced Canadian Tanner Boser on 21 December 2019.</p><p>Their bout took place in Busan, South Korea, at UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. <a href=# rel=noopener>Korean Zombie</a>. Additionally, their match was held live on the Prelims.&nbsp;</p><p>Gane is bigger than Boser, and they both showcased their own skills. As Gane portrayed his power, Boser showed his technique, changing stances and throwing more punches.</p><p>The match stood aloof till the third round; however, Gane’s power strikes did quite a lot of damage to Boser.</p><p>In the end, Gane claimed the victory by unanimous decision (30-26, 30-26, 30-26).</p><h3>Ciryl Gane vs. Junior dos Santos</h3><p>Nearly after a year, Ciryl Gane had his fight against Junior dos Santos on December 12, 2020. The match was held in UFC APEX, Las Vegas, Nevada (US), at UFC 256.</p><p>Back then, Santos was having a bad session in his career with 21-8; it was literally like walking into the lion’s den.&nbsp;</p><p>As the match advanced, Santos tried to get with the outer position while Gane was striking openly from the inner core.</p><p>However, the bout ended in the second round after Gane threw a right hook followed by an elbow putting Santos helpless inside the octagon.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ciryl Gane vs Jairzinho Rozenstruik&nbsp;</h3><p>In a match against Rozenstruik on February 27, 2021, Gane won the match via unanimous decision.</p><h3>Ciryl Gane vs Derrick Lewis&nbsp;</h3><p>Gane fought against Lewis on August 7, 2021, at UFC 265 for the Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>In this match, he won the one-sided fight via TOK in the third round. He was also able to win the performance of the night award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ciryl-Gane-vs-Derrick-Lewis-Fight.jpg><p>The professional MMA fighter faced Francis Ngannou for the UFC Heavyweight Championship on January 22, 2022, at UFC 270.

Of course, he has shown promising talent and grown coverage of the matches he has played in.</p><p>Gane is scheduled to fight Jon Jones on March 4, 2023, at UFC 285 for the vacant UFC Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>The player has recorded 11 wins; three by submission, five by knockout, and three by decision.</p><h2>Shamil Abdurakhimov’s Match And Injury</h2><p>Back in 2020, Ciryl Gane’s match with Shamil Abdurakhimov was quite an anticipated one. In fact, they were set to face each other on April 18; however, Gane had to force pull out from the bout.&nbsp;</p><p>Ciryl Gane struggled with pneumothorax (abnormal collection of air between lung and chest wall or collapsed lung, to put it in simple words) during his training.</p><p>Consequently, this isn’t the first injury Gane had in the UFC. In fact, he has been facing this problem since his early debut in the arena.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, Gane took out of UFC 249, and their bout was rescheduled on July 11, 2020, at UFC 251.</p><p>This time, Shamil Abdurakhimov was withdrawn from the bout due to some undisclosed reason.</p><p>Afterward, Gane was scheduled to face Sergei Pavlovich as a replacement for Shamil. However, Pavlovich also pulled out due to an injury.</p><p>Later, Gane and Shamil’s match was fixed for the third time. As per the news, they were to fight on 26 September 2020 at UFC 253. In the bargain, the match was again postponed to UFC Fight Night 180 on October 18, 2020.</p><p>However, Abdurakhimov again pulled out for undisclosed reasons. Therefore, the newcomer, Ante Delija, replaced Shamil.&nbsp;</p><p>As things don’t end here, Delija also pulled out of the match due to contractual problems with his previous deal with the PFL.</p><h2>Achievements&nbsp;</h2><h3><span class=mw-headline>Muay Thai (</span>Académie Française de Muay Thaï<span id=Muay_Thai class=mw-headline>)</span></h3><ul><li>AFMT National Title +201 lb (one time and one successful title defense)</li></ul><h3><span id=Mixed_martial_arts class=mw-headline>Mixed martial arts (Ultimate Fighting Championship & TKO)</span></h3><ul><li>Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship (One time)</li><li>Performance of the Night (two times)</li><li>TKO Heavyweight Championship (One time)</li></ul><h2>Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>The interim UFC heavyweight champion has an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p>In the bargain, Gane has career earnings of $1.5 million.

However, Santos had an upset law.&nbsp;</p><p>After the match, many had controversial thoughts about the ending. Those very thoughts bought up conflicts about the elbow attack of Gane.</p><p>According to the sources, Gane’s elbow attack is considered to be illegal as Santos had backed and turned away from Gane.</p><p>Gane portrayed that attack that landed on the back of Santos’ head. At times, such an attack is quite dangerous and may impact long-term effects; however, neither the referee nor anyone complained about it. Thus, it was considered legal.&nbsp;</p><p>For that exact match, <a href=# rel=noopener>Daniel Cormier</a>, Joe Rogan, and Joe Anik were on commentary duty, and they also stated that to be fine. Altogether, Gane took the victory over these claims.</p><p>Having said this, Santos was upset and complained about the attack. However, he ended up congratulating his opponent as no one raised a question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ciryl-Gane-vs.-Junior-dos-Santos.jpeg><p>“The UFC never said a word. It’s fine by them. I find that absurd. A clearly illegal shot, and the president and a bunch of fighters think that what happened was acceptable. Yes, I don’t think it was intentional, but that doesn’t make it any less illegal. I think they’re trying to make this blow over because of the negative point I currently am in my career.”<br>-Junior dos Santos</p><h3>Legalization of MMA In France</h3><p>MMA was not legalized in France. However, right before Gane’s fight with Junior dos Santos, MMA was made legal.</p><p>Obviously, as a Frenchman, Gane couldn’t be any less happy. Alongside the news of the legalization of MMA in France, it also indicated that Gane could be seen fighting by his natives.&nbsp;</p><p>As an added fact, Ciryl Gane had also depicted his wish to be the first to anchor a show at home.</p><p>“That’s really crazy. MMA started in France. I think in France, we have a big potential for the pay per view, a big potential for the fighters, the French fighters. Of course, this is a big opportunity for me too. And this [would be] a real pleasure, [to fight] in front of my family, of course, my friends and my family.”<br>-Ciryl Gane</p><h2>Ciryl Gane | Career Record</h2><h3>Kickboxing</h3><table class="infobox vcard"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><strong>Total</strong></th><td class=infobox-data>13</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><strong>Wins</strong></th><td class=infobox-data>13</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><strong>By&nbsp;knockout</strong></th><td class=infobox-data>9</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Losses</th><td class=infobox-data>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>MMA Record</h3><table class="infobox vcard"><tbody><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><b>Total</b></th><td class=infobox-data>12</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><b>Wins</b></th><td class=infobox-data>11</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>By&nbsp;knockout</th><td class=infobox-data>5</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>By&nbsp;submission</th><td class=infobox-data>3</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>By&nbsp;decision</th><td class=infobox-data>3</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><b>Losses</b></th><td class=infobox-data>1</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Wife & Kids</h2><p>An interim heavyweight champion is a married man, but the details about his wife are not available.

She is Tom McGrew’s daughter<strong>,</strong> an established American writer, while her mother’s information is unknown.</p><p>Besides her parents, young Abby grew up with her two sisters: Lacey McGrew and Molly McGrew. But it is unclear whether Abby is older than them or not.</p><p>Likewise, a native of Nashville, Abby is American by nationality while her ethnicity is white.</p><h2>Abby McGrew | Early Life And Education</h2><p>Daughter of Tom McGrew, Abby spent most of her childhood in Tennessee with her sisters. She attended the local high school, <strong>Brentwood Academy. </strong>Following high school graduation, she went to college at the<strong> University of Mississippi</strong>.</p><p>Besides that, in college, she was in a sorority. Her sorority’s name was <strong>Kappa Delta’s Alpha Mu chapter.</strong></p><p>Thereafter, she earned a degree in family and consumer sciences. Following that, she moved to New York City to work as a fashion designer. She worked under American fashion designer Pamella Roland.</p><h2>How Old Is Abby McGrew?- Age, Height, And Weight</h2><p>Beautiful and magnanimous, if there are any words to describe Abby, it would be those two. A native of Tennessee, Abby is <strong>39 years old</strong> as of now. Being born in the year 1984, McGrew celebrated her 37th birthday this year on the first of January.</p><p>How exciting must it be to celebrate the new year and birthday at the same time? Only she can relate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Abby-Mcgrew-Source-Pinterest.jpg><p>Likewise, McGrew’s zodiac sign happens to be Capricorn, known for being tenacious, smart, and kind.

It is hard to believe that Abby McGrew is a mother of four kids.</p><h2>Abby McGrew | Professional Career</h2><h3>Working Under Wedding Dress Designer</h3><p>When it comes to Abby’s work, they are not highlighted as much as her personal life, especially her married life. But she has accomplished not less in her career in a sense.</p><p>Likewise, it was mentioned that Abby really hit gold when she moved to New York City. There she really excelled as a designer and even more rekindled her relationship with Manning.</p><p>Despite that, McGrew treaded in other fields as well.</p><p>During one time, McGrew worked as an account executive for designer Pamela Roland where she learned a lot. Pamela specializes in evening wear and wedding dresses while also serving other fashion items for those who don’t know.</p><h3>Philanthropic work</h3><p>Maybe something happened to her during her New York stay, but it was after moving there Abby began volunteering for humanitarian causes. She left a meaningful contribution to <strong>York’s St. Vincent’s hospital.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Photo-of-Abby-McGrew-with-her-family.jpg><p>Aside from that, young Abby also provided scholarship grants for students in her <strong>alma mater, the University of Mississippi.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, she has continued doing such activities even after her marriage. Especially now, she works with her husband and donates to charitable causes.</p><p>Moreover, the couple donated <strong>$3 million</strong> to constructing <strong>Blair E. Batson Hospital, a children’s clinic covering a 15,600-square-foot area.</strong></p><p>They also did not pull up from donating massive amounts to develop a new birthing center at <strong>New York City’s St. Vincent’s Hospital</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, <a href=# rel=noopener>Eli Manning</a> undertook a five-year Campaign to raise <strong>$2.5 million</strong> to construct <strong>“The Eli Manning Children’s Clinic”</strong> at the children’s hospital. Talking about it, he said,</p><p>“I am humbled by the work they do and am honored to make this five-year commitment to help raise funds to build this state-of-the-art-clinic that will serve Mississippi families for years to come.”</p><p>This action came right after he and his brother, Peyton<strong>,</strong> volunteered in the<strong> wake of Hurricane Katrina</strong>.</p><p><strong>During that time, they helped deliver 30,000 pounds, approximately 14,000 kgs of water, Gatorade, baby formula, pumice, and pillows to the people of New Orleans.</strong></p><p>Even their father, Archie Manning, raised funds for <strong>Katrina</strong> relief efforts.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet Rachel Glandorf McCoy- Wife of Colt McCoy, Age, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></strong></p><h2>Eli Manning’s Wife Abby McGrew | Personal Life And Marriage</h2><h3>Relationship And Wedding</h3><p><strong>As we covered above, Abby is famous as the wife of former NFL star <a href=# rel=noopener>Eli Manning</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>The two lovebirds have been married for over 12 years now.</strong></p><p>But their history dates back to college days in 2002 when they met for the first time.</p><p>Abby met Manning for the first time while they were students at the University of Mississippi. They started dating and slowly took their relationship to the next level.</p><p>Finally, after dating for five whole years, Eli proposed to Abby with a stunning engagement ring. They got engaged in 2007.</p><p>Likewise, a year later, Eli and Abby exchanged vows in a private ceremony held in <strong>San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, on April 19.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, their wedding came shortly after Eli’s first <strong>Super Bowl ring with the New York Giants.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/abby-004.jpg><p>Moreover, Abby and Eli are not only lovely couples but also loving parents to their four children. Yes, as of now, the two have welcomed four beautiful children into their lives.</p><h3>Kids And Pet</h3><p>Abby first gave birth to Ava Frances, their first child, and a daughter on March 21, 2010, followed by Lucy Thomas on June 17, 2013.</p><p>Similarly, two years later, the couple added a new member to their family on January 29, 2015, and named her Caroline Olivia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Abby-And-Family.jpg><p>Last year on February 3, the couple shocked their fans by welcoming another child, their first son, on<strong> Super Bowl Sunday</strong>. The couple named their son<strong> Elisha Manning</strong> after Eli himself.</p><p>According to Newsday, the baby boy was born just after midnight, joining his<strong> sisters: Ava, 7, Lucy, 5, and Caroline, 4. Eli,</strong> who was uncertain about the number of kids they will have back in 2014, now has four to occupy his time.</p><p>Back then, the <strong>NFL</strong> star shared the best fatherhood advice he ever received with the U.S., which still applies.</p><p>“It goes by quickly. You hear that from a lot of parents. They’re 3 years old and then you look up and they’re graduating high school and they’re graduating college. So just enjoy every moment that you have with them and every little period in their life is precious.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Eli-And-Hank-dog-Source-Twitter.jpg><p><strong>As of now, the family of six is residing in their huge mansion located in New Jersey.</strong></p><p>They have a golden retriever named, Hank.</p><h2>Abby McGrew| Net Worth And Income</h2><p>Since McGrew is not as vocal about her professional career as she is about her philanthropic work, we have no idea how much she benefits from her job. As of 2023, Abby’s net worth is unknown.</p><p>However, it seems money is the least of her problem. We think it is safe to assume that Abby shares her husband’s wealth, Eli, pretty much as everything else.</p><p>According to sources, <a href=# rel=noopener>Eli Manning</a> has a staggering net worth of<strong> $150 million</strong>. Not to mention, he makes <strong>$18 million</strong> alone from his salary.</p><p><strong>Now retired, the former professional football quarterback dedicated 16 years of his career to New York Giants.</strong></p><p>Eli was the highest-earning player in league history during his retirement, with career earnings worth <strong>$252 million</strong> in salary alone.</p><p>Aside from that, Manning also earned <strong>$8-10 million</strong> per year promoting brands like <strong>Gatorade, DirecTV, Toyota, Reebok, Kraft, Citizen, and Samsung.</strong></p><p>Moreover, the star football quarterback also co-starred in campaigns alongside his brother, <strong>Peyton, for NFLShop.com and Oreo.</strong></p><p>Eli Manning puts his <strong>NJ mansion</strong> in the market for $5.25 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/eli-manning-summit-nj-house-for-sale.jpg><p>Just today, <strong>TMJ Sports</strong> reported that the former professional football star put his New Jersey mansion on the market for<strong> $5.25 million</strong>. So why is the estate worth so much?</p><p><strong>Well, for starters, the mansion was built in 1904 and renovated by Eli back in 2015.</strong></p><p><strong>The 9,000-square-foot home consists of six bedrooms, five full bathrooms, four half baths, eight fireplaces, a substantial marbled-out gourmet kitchen, and even a fully equipped home gym.</strong></p><p>Likewise, this mansion sits on 1.1 acres with an in-ground pool in the backyard, which hits during those cruel New Jersey winters, plus has a golf simulator inside the house. Not to mention, it also has a huge wine cellar and can hold up to 750 bottles.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal Maurisa Goins Age, Height, Family, Husband, Career, Instagram >></a></strong></p><h2>Abby McGrew | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Like her husband, McGrew is not a big fan of social media.

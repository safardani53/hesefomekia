He has&nbsp;consistently won every freestyle competition he has&nbsp;ever entered for decades. His admirers have often complimented his oddly serene appearance in every skate video&nbsp;he has&nbsp;shot. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The construction of the foundation on which modern street skating was developed is generally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">credited</a> to Mullen. Curiously, there are reports of him being autistic as well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Whether He Is Autistic Or Not Is Uncertain</h2><p>No evidence is available as to whether or not Rodney is autistic. However, it was reported that he displayed symptoms of Autism.&nbsp;<span>Mullen himself </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>mentioned</span></a><span>&nbsp;that he thinks that he may be autistic. That would&nbsp;seem </span>to bear out the single-minded concentration and the almost ethereal aptitude he has displayed over the years for skateboarding. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Autistic people&nbsp;also show similar motivation and attention. They are driven to pursue their chosen art incessantly by some mystical inner mechanism, mixing native raw talent with knowledge and skills well beyond what can be accomplished by neurotypical individuals.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Rodney looked at the skateboard&nbsp;and saw an entity in three dimensions.&nbsp;He thought you didn't have to sit on the deck. You could flip it down and skate on it. You could slide on the edge of it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">autistic</a> people, the&nbsp;capacity to deconstruct game rules and look at a convention from beyond normal capacity is standard.&nbsp;Mullen also reflected that he may exhibit other typical traits associated with ASD. <span>Mullen was extremely&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>vulnerable</span></a><span>&nbsp;and sometimes ran away</span> from the team he was a part of, only to turn up hours later by himself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mullen has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family background</a>, as many other autistic individuals, which indicates ties to the syndrome: his mother was diagnosed with Autism. She is&nbsp;a scholar, graduating from high school at the age of 14 and later receiving a degree in physics while also becoming an excellent pianist.</p><h2>The Rise Of The Skateboarding Prodigy&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mullen was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> with metatarsus varus, a disease that caused both feet to point inward, better known as pigeon toes. This was a major downside in a sport where the ability to manipulate the board with both feet freely is everything. Yet Mullen wore boots designed to correct the situation and obsessively worked on the board to refine his strategy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Facing initial concerns, in 1977, when he was ten years old, his father finally&nbsp;bought Rodney his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first skateboard</a>, on the condition that he would still wear his safety pads and avoid skating the moment he was injured. He entered his first contest the same year and came third; later, he would take first place in every game he enteredâ€”almost thirty in all in the next three years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 1980, Rodney started his competitive skating career with the Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade after winning the Oasis Pro competition in San Diego. He would create moves that would revolutionize the sport of skating, such as the flat-ground ollie, Kicklip, Heelflip, and 360 Flip.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2002, Mullen received the Skater of the Year Transworld Readers' Choice Award and created the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">company</a> Almost Skateboards. In 2003, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">published</a>&nbsp;'The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself,' an autobiography. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>A Career In Motivating Others With Speeches</h2><p>As a sought-after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speaker</a> at PopTech, Foo Camp, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TEDx</a>, and several other gatherings where technology bigwigs meet to feast on ideas, Mullen is making rounds at Silicon Valley conference circuits. About 1.9 million <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">views</a> were created for his first-ever appearance on TED. In comparison, his YouTube skate videos and interviews have tens of millions of views. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Today, Mullen is in high <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">demand</a>. Over the years, it seems that Mullen has been able to transcend many of his autism traits to interact and respond more similarly to the way a neurotypical personality might be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e8pbrEsmSmrZyhsq95wK6roqudY7W1ucs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frodney-mullen-autism-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mcdonalds-bacon-double-cheeseburger-menu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mcdonalds-bacon-double-cheeseburger-menu.html>McDonald's bacon double cheeseburger sends fans wild as it's FINALLY rolled out... but some reckon t</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./guy-fieris-nacho-sliders-see-easy-cinco-de-mayo-recipe.html>Guy Fieri's Nacho Sliders: See Easy Cinco de Mayo Recipe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./guy-fieris-nacho-sliders-see-easy-cinco-de-mayo-recipe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

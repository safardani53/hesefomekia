There's the tricky business of discovering what type of home you're allowed to build as per your town/county's guidelines, then comes the messy business of picking all of the external materials, the type of heating/water solutions <a href=#>you'll want for the home</a>, and not to mention all of the fixtures and finer details that go along with that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And the cost of these materials, because more often than not they're designed to last a lifetime if not multiple lifetimes (at least back in the day they were, you know how many mustard-colored refrigerators from the '70s are still around today?) are through the wazoo.</p><p>But if you're someone who is dead set on a specific aesthetic, and it's hard to blame you, this is a whole ass house we're talking about here, then you know how once a specific design element sticks out to you, eliminating it from your architectural vocabulary is extremely difficult.</p><p>Like this couple that wanted frosted windows in their home so they wouldn't have to worry about hanging blinds op opting for very expensive privacy glass.</p><p>They had hoped that the frosted look would block whoever was passing by from seeing what was going on in the house.</p><p>But this just was simply not the case.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>A West-Knoxville Tennessee couple uploaded a video of them making the shocking discovery after peering into the house and having someone standing right in front of the mirror (with an internal light on, of course.)</p><p>What they discovered was that the frosted glass didn't leave much to the imagination of The Santoms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mama_jill34</span></figure><p>Jill and her husband wanted to conduct a little domicile experiment to see if passers by were able to peak into their homes through the frosted glass windows.</p><p>And they discovered that their privacy windows weren't as private as they thought.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mama_jill34</span></figure><p>We're talking full blown silhouettes. Sure, it's not like anyone's going to peep your genitals or anything, but if you decided to get frisky with someone in the bathroom, or if you're taking a shower, or bending over to vigorously wipe your butthole, then these frosted glass windows probably aren't a good idea.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mama_jill34</span></figure><p>Jill said, "One night I was getting my mail and my husband was up there in the bathroom with the light on and I glanced up and am like wow that's really bright compared to the darkness of the neighborhood."</p><p>That's when she decided to try out the experiment with her husband, "I ran inside and said hey go up there and pretend you are taking a shower just so I can see if people have been seeing us for a year up in our bathroom. He took the task and really ran with it and did his best fake showering, acting he has ever done."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mama_jill34</span></figure><p>So to fix the issue that they've come across, they just decided to hang up a curtain. Sure, it's not as clean or elegant of a solution as just a singular window panel you can't see through (hanging curtains are on the same level of annoyance as floor lamps) but at least they don't have to worry about strangers seeing everything that they're doing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mama_jill34</span></figure><p>The response to Jill's now viral TikTok video has been tremendous. She stated that prior to publishing the clip her TikTok account comprised of about 20 or so friends she knew in real life.</p><p>As of this writing, she's managed to accumulate some 22.5k followers, and the couple is continuing to upload videos with even more frosted glass tomfoolery. But for that, they take the shower curtain down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy2vMueZJ%2Bqn6jBprCMoKOaq6NixKq6w6iu</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcouple-frosted-glass-window.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gurratan-singh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gurratan-singh.html>Fame | Gurratan Singh net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas.html>Lauren Conrad Heidi Montag 2006 VMAs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

all of whom will be cheered on by a raucous O2 crowd filled with their adoring fans and loved ones.</p><p>Such a scenario would've been unfathomable during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC</a>'s first forays to the UK, which were by and large cards sprinkled with a handful of Brits.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON UFC LONDON">READ MORE ON UFC LONDON</h2><p>But the boom in mixed martial arts foreseen by the promotion when they first visited England nearly 20 years has well and truly bore fruit.</p><p>Epitomising the rise of the Brits during the pandemic is main eventer Tom Aspinall, who will look to catapult himself into heavyweight title contention with a victory over former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellator</a> champ Alexander Volkov.</p><p>The Wigan warrior made his octagon debut four months into the pandemic and hasn't looked back since - racking up three TKO wins and a solitary submission victory.</p><p>And whether he likes it or not, a fifth win on the bounce will put the 28-year-old on the cusp of a crack at UFC gold.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS -

which is only missing a marquee name to propel himself into the upper echelons of the division.</p><p>Title contention could also be on the horizon for Scottish submission specialist Paul Craig should he continue his rich vein of form against Russian Nikita Krylov.</p><p>The Airdrie Assassin is undefeated in his last five outings to the octagon and most recently scored an<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> emphatic first-round TKO victory over prospect Jamahal Hill at UFC 263</a> last June.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC London</a>'s most prominent Welsh representative, Jack Shore, will also be poised to mix it with the bantamweight division's elite should he get past Russian Timur Valiev.</p><p>The Abertillery Tank has breezed through all the competition he's faced during his two-and-half-year stint in the promotion and his well-roundedness has drawn plaudits from some big names in the sport.</p><p>The unofficial star of the UFC London show is undoubtedly Liverpudlian Paddy Pimblett, who made a spectacular debut at the promotion's Apex facility last September.</p><p>Pimblett captivated hardcore and casual fans alike with his stunning victory over Luigi Vendramini last September and his brashness, which some have compared to future Hall of Famer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Conor McGregor</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/40edb2b2-1ee2-4f61-83c3-d31be3de9044.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000660695188.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/46abdc14-0fc3-4607-8b5c-64f31c9651a4.jpg><p>Kazula Vargas will look to spoil the Pimblett party, although he must first win the battle of nerves that comes with fighting on enemy territory.</p><p>Pimblett's Next Generation team-mate Molly McCann will also look to make a statement against Brazilian Luana Carolina following victory in her make-or-break clash with Ji Yeon Kim.</p><p>McCann's steeliness in the face of the UFC axe last September was awe-inspiring, to say the least, and has given new life to her bid to become a two-promotion flyweight champion.</p><p>The same can be said for Black Country Jai Herbert, who saved his UFC bacon last October with a stunning stoppage victory over Khama Worthy.</p><p>The former Cage Warriors lightweight champion finally showed the skills European MMA fans have long been accustomed to seeing in his maiden UFC triumph, although he'll need them and more to defeat THE fearsome Ilia Topuria.</p><p>It wouldn't be a UFC card if there wasn't a fighter entering their bout with their back physically and metaphorically against the cage fence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/799a99d3-9b4b-4f83-ac45-559e711fd59b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000719826825-1.jpg><p>And that's where 2014 Commonwealth Games Bronze medallist Mike Grundy finds himself ahead of his eagerly-anticipated featherweight showdown with Makwan Amirkhani.</p><p>Defeat to Mr Finland could spell the end of Grundy's stint in the UFC, but he'll enter the cage more motivated than ever following his father's recent diagnosis with a terminal illness.</p><p>Wales' Cory McKenna - who was once the youngester fighter on the roster - will also be champing at the bit to make a statement in her strawweight showdown with Elise Reed following a lengthy hiatus from the cage.</p><p>Kicking off the UFC's eagerly-anticipated will be decorated amateur and former refugee Muhammad Mokaev, who will be welcomed to the octagon by Cody Durden.</p><p>Mokaev is perhaps the most experienced amateur to ever enter the octagon having had 23 fights before turning pro in 2020.</p><p>Such a showcase of up-and-coming and potentially title-challenging UK fighters would've been unthinkable a mere five years ago.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>But this crop of battling Brits -

<time>06 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>WHEN it comes to what's on our plate it can be hard to wade through what's right and wrong.</p><p>Food is there to fuel us and give us energy, but with so much misinformation around it can be hard to know what's really good for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dr-Saleh.png><p>Posting to <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> one doctor has put to bed the top 12 food myths once and for all.</p><p>1. <strong>Does calcium give you strong bones?</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dr Siyamak Saleh</a> started with one of the most common sayings, which is that milk builds strong bones.</p><p>Many people think this is the case as there is a high amount of calcium in milk.</p><p>The NHS says that milk and dairy products, such as cheese and yoghurt, are great sources of protein and calcium - but adds that the fat in dairy products can add up.</p><p>Dr Saleh added: "Multiple studies didn't find a link between milk and strong bones/fractures.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Diet & Fitness</h2></p><p>"Some studies found fractures are more frequent with more milk consumption."</p><p><strong>2. Is Himalayan salt better than other salts?</strong></p><p>You might have heard Himalayan salt being favoured by foodies, but Dr Saleh said it isn't better than normal salt.</p><p>He explained: "Himalayan salt has more minerals but they are in such small amount that makes no difference."</p><p>It's important that you monitor your salt intake as a diet high in salt (or sodium) can cause raised blood pressure, which can increase your risk of <a href=#>heart disease</a> and stroke, the NHS says.</p><p>3. <strong>Does</strong> <strong>eating fat make you fat?</strong></p><p>Fat is an essential part of our diet as it is a source of essential fatty acids,&nbsp;which the body cannot make&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Dr Saleh said that eating foods with fat in them won't actually make you fat, but that it might contribute to your overall health.</p><p>He said: "Eating fat doesn't make you fatter, it's rather the higher calorie intake! Healthy fats are associated with higher satiety."</p><p>4. <strong>Are brown eggs better than white eggs?</strong></p><p>If you like a scrambled egg or even a delicious omelette then you might not be paying too much attention as the what the eggs look like on the outside.</p><p>But some people associated better egg quality with the colour of the shell, however Dr Saleh said that the colour of the shell doesn't really matter.</p><p>"Brown and white eggs are exactly the same - the colour depends on the type of chicken", he said.</p><p id=do-spicy-foods-cause-ulcers>5<strong>. Do spicy foods cause ulcers?</strong></p><p>Ulcers are caused by a number of things such as biting the inside of your cheek or a food intolerance.</p><p>They are not caused by spicy foods, Dr Saleh says - but it's probably best that if you have an ulcer you avoid them.</p><p>He added: "Ulcers are caused by regular intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and H.Pylori bacteria.</p><p>"Spicy foods only aggravates it."</p><p>6. <strong>Do detox diets cleanse your body?</strong></p><p>Any food pattern with the word diet in it is likely designed to help you lose weight.</p><p>Some people will go on so-called 'detox diets' if they are concerned about their liver or kidneys.</p><p>But Dr Saleh said it's not diets that cleanse your body.</p><p>"Liver and kidneys detox your body! All the detox diets are just healthy foods", he said.</p><p>7. <strong>Is the vegan diet the healthiest diet?</strong></p><p>Many people who follow a vegan diet take supplements to help them obtain nutrients they might not be getting from their food.</p><p>Dr Saleh said: "Vegan diet has a lot of health benefits and probably one of the healthiest diets but can lead to some nutrients deficiencies."</p><p>8. <strong>Does cranberry juice cure UTIs</strong>?</p><p>It's a common saying that you should have cranberry juice if you have a water infection.</p><p>But Dr Saleh said it doesn't actually help.</p><p>"UTIs are infections that are only treatable with antibiotics and not a juice - around 45 per cent of UTIs resolve by themselves."</p><p>9. <strong>Does water have an expiry date?</strong></p><p>This is a myth as water itself doesn't have an expiry date, but Dr Saleh said it actually depends on how it's packaged.</p><p>"Water doesn't have an expiry date but the bottles do because the plastic starts to leach into the water over time", he added.</p><p>10. <strong>Are frozen vegetables bad for you?</strong></p><p>Many people believe that fresh veggies are better than frozen ones, but Dr Saleh says this isn't the case.</p><p>"Fresh veggies start losing nutrients once harvested so freezing them will prolong the shelf life of the nutrients."</p><p>11. <strong>Is white chocolate the same as normal chocolate?</strong></p><p>This might come as a surprise but you can't actually class white chocolate as chocolate.</p><p>Dr Saleh explained: "White chocolate is made with sugar, milk products, vanilla and cacao butter but not the actual cacao solids so technically not a chocolate."</p><p>12. <strong>Do instant noodles cause cancer?</strong></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>This is a no, instant noodles do not cause cancer.</p><p>Dr Saleh said: "Instant noodles containing wax and causing cancer is just a myth! So enjoy them."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxyg5dpa3JwaWSxsK%2FTqKlmnp%2BksW652K2frGWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoctor-food-myths-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paige-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paige-thomas.html>Paige Thomas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amber-belus.html>Amber Belus - Distractify</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amber-belus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

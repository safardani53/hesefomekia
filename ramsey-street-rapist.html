After six rapes occurred both on Ramsey Street and its surrounding areas between March of 2006 and January of 2008, it soon became known as a sight for terror.</p><p>The culprit attacked many of his victims from behind, and they mainly occurred outside of apartment complexes. Several of the attacks occurred within days of one another. &nbsp;</p><p>Authorities were able to obtain DNA from the sites where the sexual assaults occurred, and they soon came to the conclusion that they were all committed by the same man. But, because the culprit's DNA was not already in the system, investigators were unable to determine who he was.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, the attacks appeared to cease in 2008 without an arrest being made.</p><p>Aside from the DNA that led nowhere at the time, the victims had disparate memories about what the assailant looked like. While many agreed that he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt during the assaults, they could not come to a conclusion about his height or his build.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these factors contributed to the cases remaining unsolved for more than a decade.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Ramsey Street Rapist was identified in 2018.</h2><p>In 2016, investigators sent a sample of the suspect's DNA to Parabon NanoLabs. CeCe Moore, who is the head of the lab, began constructing an image of what the rapist might have looked like when he committed the sexual assaults. This image was then publicized and the authorities asked people to send in tips.</p><p>When this didn't work, officers hired Parabon NanoLabs to construct a genetic profile of the rapist. They used ancestry websites and relatives of the rapist to create a family tree.</p><p>In 2018, a 43-year-old man named Darold Wayne Bowden was arrested in connection to the rapes. Bowden had been arrested in the past for a string of petty crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>He was held in the Cumberland County Detention Center after his arrest in August of 2018 on an $18.8 million bond. Bowden's request for a bail reduction was denied.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>He was charged with three counts of first-degree rape, four counts of second degree rape, 13 counts of second-degree forcible sex offense, six counts of first-degree kidnapping, five counts of first-degree burglary, and multiple counts of larceny and possession of stolen goods, among other charges.&nbsp;</p><p>The Genetic Detective airs on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66uv8SyZKysopqytXnRmqeiq6Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2framsey-street-rapist.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-jomari-goyso-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-jomari-goyso-dating.html>Who is Jomari Goyso Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leicester-sack-lydia-bedford-wsl.html>Leicester City sacks Lydia Bedford after six-game losing run with Willie Kirk to take charge of thei</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./leicester-sack-lydia-bedford-wsl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

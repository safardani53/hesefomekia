Then, I did the ligaments in my ankles. It was a bit of a nightmare of a first year."</p><p>On his medical, he added: "I failed it and they didn’t want to sign me. My agent, he did well, he asked them: ‘You’re the best medical staff in the world, and you’re failing him over a hernia?’ They said, we can look after him, and they put it through.’"</p><p>After initial struggles with injuries he settled into Bayern's second team, but never managed to break into their senior side.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a aria-label="FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS & NEW CUSTOMER BONUSES</a></strong></p><p>The closest he came was featuring in a friendly against&nbsp;SpVgg Unterhaching alongside the likes of <a href=#>David Alaba</a> and <a href=#>Rafinha</a>.</p><p>In 2013, two seasons into his three-year deal, Jennings decided to call time on his unlikely Bayern dream and come home.</p><p>He made a transfer similarly unusual to his previous one, swapping Bayern for <a href=#>Barnsley</a>.</p><p>Upon making the move, he told the BBC: "I was a bit gutted not to break into the first team but I learned a lot from my time at Bayern.</p><p>"I was only 18 going over there, and it took me six to eight months to get used to it. It's a very good level, the German style of playing is perhaps the best at the moment."</p><p>On his reasons for leaving, Jennings added: "It's such a massive club it's very hard to break through. With a year left I thought it was best to move on.</p><p>"I was feeling a bit homesick and to be fair they said what mattered most was my happiness."</p><p>In his first season at Oakwell, the Tykes were relegated from the <a href=#>Championship</a>, sending Jennings back to League One, three years on from leaving Tranmere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'FOOTBALL BECAME IRRELEVANT THEN'</h2><p>He later briefly returned to the second tier with MK Dons, but only featured twice before football understandably took a back seat as his young daughter Mila twice suffered from cancer.</p><p>"Football became irrelevant then," he told The Athletic.</p><p>“We went through these horrible two years. She fought that [leukaemia] and got the all-clear and then two months later she was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour in her kidney.</p><p>"It was nothing to do with leukaemia – a different type of cancer altogether. By the age of six she’d had cancer twice.</p><p>"She has had chemo, radiotherapy and the tumour removed. It’s unbelievable what she’s been through for a little kid."</p><p>In 2018, following brave Mila's battle, Jennings returned to football in non-league with Runcorn Town.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Who are these famous footballers?</h3></p><p>He went on to have stints with Ramsbottom United and Prescot Cables, as well as a spell in Wales with Prestatyn Town.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Many have spoken of Jennings' failure to break through at Bayern, but things could have gone differently.</p><p>He claims to have had a "decent career" despite his setbacks, and he's probably right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12516af4-bba6-4fe8-bc5a-613bd2b1b59c.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2005-like-opponents-members-north-868649520.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZdwZ2pqX5murbGMo5ynppmjtLR5wZqwnqqeYrq2usicn2asopa7rrHRnmStqpGjwKex0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdale-jennings-bayern-munich-tranmere-transfer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8vuaf-d59wgmjkq2xmdiwqdgyrv-uppi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8vuaf-d59wgmjkq2xmdiwqdgyrv-uppi.html>Watch Ridiculousness Season 8 Episode 4: Chanel and Sterling XXVIII</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christine-mcguinness-paddy-family-christmas.html>Christine McGuinness shares snaps Christmas with ex Paddy after revealing hes dating again</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christine-mcguinness-paddy-family-christmas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

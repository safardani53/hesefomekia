It’s hard to keep people’s real lives a secret.</p><p>But not every couple on this season of The Other Way is as transparent.</p><p>While some stars are in America, others are almost ghosts outside of their on-screen storylines.</p><p>Let’s take a look at everything that we know about the Season 3 couples and the fates of their relationships:</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh are OGs of this series.</p><p>Out of three seasons of this spinoff, they have appeared on all three.</p><p>But given the promos and their first episode of Season 3, it looked like it could be their last.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jenny’s visa renewal was denied, according to an email that she received.</p><p>With Sumit continuing to refuse to marry her despite his past promises, she flipped out.</p><p>The idea that he would expect her to leave for months and then return as a "tourist" was absurd and hurtful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sumit acted as if marriage was not an option, even though it is — seemingly the only option.</p><p>He feels inexplicably beholden to his parents’ wishes, and they refuse to give him his blessing to marry.</p><p>The one piece of good news is that the email turned out to be a glitch, and Jenny’s visa extension was approved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This season is going to be filled with shenanigans as Jenny and Sumit scheme to stay together without marrying.</p><p>They are also going to try to win over the approval of Sumit’s controlling, toxic parents.</p><p>Whether or not that’s a worthwhile endeavor is moot; Sumit seems incapable of making decisions on his own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We don’t know everything that will unfold for Jenny and Sumit, but we do know some things.</p><p>First, they are still together — as of very recent interviews (interviews given many, many months after filming ended).</p><p>Second, that it is claimed that they are married, but they have not confirmed it due to their NDA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Another familiar couple is Ariela Weinberg and Biniyam Shibre.</p><p>They are one step ahead of Jenny and Sumit, in that they became engaged at the very end of Season 2.</p><p>Just as Jenny received a promise ring, Ariela received an engagement ring … with a value of less than $1.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This season, we have seen Biniyam’s childish jealousy on full display.</p><p>The Leandro drama is … very silly, and has left some fans divided.</p><p>But we know that real drama is coming — when Ariela has to take baby Avi to New Jersey for delicate hernia surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to what little was shared in the teaser, it looks like there was a lot of contention.</p><p>Ariela is heard saying something about "never" returning to Ethiopia.</p><p>And as of this week, Ariela appears to still be in the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ariela shared that she is receiving help for her TMJ issues from a dentist in Manhattan.</p><p>While it’s possible that she received this help and took photos months ago and only now shared them … that’s a bit of a leap.</p><p>Considering that eyewitnesses recently spotted her in New York, it seems likely to assume that she’s still there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But Ariela was spotted with Biniyam just a few weeks ago, also in New York, which raises more questions.</p><p>The two have also recorded interviews side-by-side, giving out mild spoilers in the same way as Jenny and Sumit.</p><p>So not only are they clearly still together, some fans suspect that they are filming again for the franchise — perhaps for Season 9 of 90 Day Fiance?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kenneth Niedermeier and Armando Rubio are one of the franchise’s most beloved couples.</p><p>This season, they are of course still together and still engaged.</p><p>They have different visions for their wedding, but they’re both intent upon having one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It’s true that these two have challenges to overcome — they wouldn’t be on television if they did not.</p><p>However, despite some homesickness and different ideas about guest lists, their major obstacles are external.</p><p>Homophobic red tape preventing them from marrying, seeking acceptance from Armando’s family … these struggles weigh on their minds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But there is good news.</p><p>In May of 2021, Kenneth and Armando announced that they were married.</p><p>As an established couple on the show, sharing that kind of detail isn’t a huge spoiler. But it’s heartwarming to hear!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Corey Rathgeber and Evelin Villegas are back, and that’s no surprise.</p><p>Evelin is one of the most intensely hated stars in the franchise’s history, which is … quite something, considering some of her competition.</p><p>She and Corey are shown planning their (expensive) wedding after a "break."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, the two have been seen together as recently as July of this year, long after they finished filming.</p><p>These two have had numerous breakups and "breaks" since we first saw them.</p><p>But they appear to still be together. Whether it’s happily ever after or not … that’s tricky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>However, Corey recently asked his followers to stop being cruel to Evelin.</p><p>Nice, right? Apparently not, if her follow-up Instagram Story is to be believed.</p><p>According to Evelin, Corey was just doing to post as part of a "good guy" act and doesn’t really care about her mental health. Messy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ellie Rose and Victor McLean appear to be, on the surface, a healthy couple.</p><p>They are age-appropriate. They’ve both been in relationships before.</p><p>Ellie is leaving behind her life in Seattle to move to the small island of Providencia with him. Sweet, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sweet … but some of Ellie’s friends are concerned.</p><p>She has given him thousands of dollars to fix up his home … and he also very seriously cheated on her.</p><p>And her friends don’t even seem to know about the worst part: <a href=#>Victor’s domestic violence record</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ellie and Victor have not been active or present on social media (except for Ellie’s efforts to fundraise for storm-ravaged Providencia).</p><p>Signs have shown that Ellie may be back in Seattle and once again running her restaurant.</p><p>But given that Victor was reportedly seen in the area as well, it’s possible that he is in the US on a K-1 visa, possibly even filming for Season 9.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Steven Johnston and Alina are another new couple, and they are wildly enigmatic.</p><p>(So new that we’re still guessing at Alina’s last name — even at a surname for her stage name)</p><p>As we said, newer couples seem to have stricter NDAs because them being together is still a spoiler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>These two have some real issues, including differences of culture.</p><p>Steven is a devout Mormon, and has convinced Alina to save herself for marriage.</p><p>Of course, Steven has had sex before and hasn’t told her that … which is just plain messy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>They have other issues that could drive them apart, but dishonesty can always be a factor.</p><p>She’s also 20 years old, which is simply way too young to be married.</p><p>There’s no smoking gun. However, given that the two have been actively liking each other’s posts as recently as a few weeks ago … they’re probably still together.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WGcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5kraCVYry1tMSrZLCZqWLAsbvIpZyrq12staqvx2aqnpmjpLtuf4ycpq6onJrAbq3RnmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-spoilers-which-season-3-couples-are.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./place-in-the-suns-jasmine-harman-jonnie-irwin-reunite.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./place-in-the-suns-jasmine-harman-jonnie-irwin-reunite.html>A Place in the Sun's Jasmine Harman pays poignant tribute to Jonnie Irwin as they reunite amid termi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./susan-koeppen-krsa-html.html>Susan Koeppen (Journalist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./susan-koeppen-krsa-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

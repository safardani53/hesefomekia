Taylor was one of the first to wear the red lapel ribbon, brandishing the ribbon at the 1992 Academy Awards. “She wore it proudly, and she wore it the rest of her life,” Laela told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> in 2017. “She took what became an important symbol and helped create a bigger movement around it because she had the ability to reach so many people.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Naomi deLuce Wilding</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/naomi-deluce-wilding-elizabeth-taylors-grandchildren-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born in 1976, <strong>Naomi deLuce Wilding</strong> is Elizabeth Taylor’s second grandchild and the sister to Laela Wilding.

Naomi recalled how her grandmother was applauded during an appearance in London in 1992 at a tribute concert honoring <strong>Freddie Mercury</strong>. “For our grandmother, the importance of it, was to show the fight against AIDS was — and is — really about educating people and destigmatizing [the disease],” she told Town & Country. “It was especially important because anybody who wore the ribbon wore it with a great deal of pride and solidarity.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I remember sitting on the floor of her dressing room and just watching her get ready — just [watching] this sort of transformation unfold,” Naomi shared with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>. “Just because somebody is a superstar doesn’t also mean that they can’t be a loving, squishy, delicious grandma who was always welcoming us in.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Caleb Wilding</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/caleb-wilding-wilding-elizabeth-taylors-grandchildren-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Caleb Wilding</strong> was born in 1983 and is the first of Elizabeth Taylor’s grandsons.

Lowell also works as an ambassador for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. “I was always in total awe of the good my grandmother was able to accomplish in her lifetime. She could so easily have done nothing, like so many others. Instead she fought, she cared, and she worked for people suffering with HIV/AIDS. I hope to do whatever I can to preserve and continue that legacy,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Quinn Tivey</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quinn-tivey-elizabeth-taylors-grandchildren-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I always just knew her as Grandma,” <strong>Quinn Tivey</strong> told Town & Country. “She was the woman I could lie in bed with to chat and watch movies.” Quinn – the son of Liza Todd and artist <strong>Happy Tivey, </strong>born in 1986 <strong>&nbsp;</strong>– works as an artist and co-trustee of the Elizabeth Taylor Trust.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Hearing from people personally about how the work that she had done touched so many people, my cousin and I were both so moved,” he recalls. “I immediately thought, I need to get more involved. I want to dive into the deep end of this. Through that experience, we had the opportunity to see how crucial it was for her family to be participating in her legacy.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Rhys Tivey</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rhys-tivey-elizabeth-taylors-grandchildren-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>“My grandmother wanted to go right for the jugular of the problem,” Rhys Tivey said in 2017. “She always wanted to do the hardest and most unlikely thing first.” Rhys, the second son of Happy Tivey and Liza Todd, earned a bachelor’s degree in jazz performance from New York University.

Elizabeth has fond memories of her grandmother. “For my junior and senior prom, she did my hair and makeup,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Town & Country</a>. “Once, while we were discussing makeup, I told her we should go to Sephora, which turned out to be a terrible idea. We had fun for the first 15 minutes, but then she was recognized, and we quickly had to be escorted out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Elizabeth Carson works as a social worker in New York and serves as an ambassador for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. “My grandmother used her fame to her advantage to gain public attention for a disease that people were not only fearful of but often in total denial about,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>. “I work for the Department of Child Protection in New York City, and, I have to say, whenever I hear of a baby born from an HIV+ mother test negative because of advancements in medication and prevention, I am literally brought to tears. I often say a silent thanks to my grandmother because if not for her and other advocates with her shared passion, this may not have been the case today.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Richard McKeown</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-19>Elizabeth Taylor’s last grandchild is <strong>Richard McKeown</strong>, the son of <strong>Maria Burton. </strong>Elizabeth and Richard adopted Maria (right as Elizabeth was wrapping up her fourth marriage to <strong>Eddie Fisher</strong>.)

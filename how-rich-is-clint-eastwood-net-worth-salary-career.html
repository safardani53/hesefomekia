<time>17 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Clint Eastwood</strong> was awarded $2 million in a case in which he accused a CBD shop of exploiting his name to promote their goods.&nbsp;After his complaint claimed that CBD producers and marketers fabricated news stories and search results to make it seem as if Eastwood was advocating their products, the jury ruled in his favor. According to the last month’s order:</p><p>“$2 million is a realistic estimate of the fair market worth of Mr. Eastwood’s services in giving his important and well-known name to a hidden metatag campaign for items he probably would not have endorsed in the first place.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Judge hands Clint Eastwood huge win in trademark case. Awards legend $2 million. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TPMh4GCU9C</a></p><p>— Frank Aiken a Patriot for Trump. (@awesomeaiken) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2022</a></p><p>Eastwood sued CBD firms in 2020, claiming that he was never involved in the cannabis sector. According to the complaint, Norok Innovation designed an internet scheme using his celebrity to lure customers to a website advertising CBD products.&nbsp;Eastwood, on the other hand, did not get the three million dollars he claimed. According to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney, the sum Eastwood sought was not excessive in light of the defendants’ illegal behavior in abusing and manipulating Plaintiff’s rights for commercial gain.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Clint-Eastwood-2.jpg alt="Clint Eastwood" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the court, Eastwood previously committed to an endorsement arrangement for a Super Bowl television ad in 2012 that highlighted the country’s comeback from the recession. He said that he accepted compensation that was less than his market worth since he was passionate about the commercial’s message.</p><h2>Clint Eastwood’s Net worth</h2><p>Clint Eastwood rose to prominence after acting in the western television series Rawhide and the Dollars Trilogy. For two years, he was also the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The 92-year-net old’s worth is estimated to be approximately $375 million as of November 2023 by CelebrityNetWorth. He has amassed a substantial fortune as a result of his profession in the entertainment sector.</p><p>In 1984, he was awarded $12 million for his performance in Any Which Way But Loose and $5 million for his involvement in City Heat. In 1993, he earned roughly $7 million for his role in In the Line of Fire.&nbsp;Eastwood also owns a number of mansions. In California, he owns a 15,000-square-foot residence in Carmel-by-the-Sea, a 6,136-square-foot house near Bel Air, and a 1,067-acre Rising River Ranch in Burney. He also has another one near his main Bel Air property. He has a 1.5-acre beachside property on Maui, as well as a 5,700-square-foot home in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Clint-Eastwood-3.jpg alt="Clint Eastwood" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the late 1990s, the Pebble Beach Golf Links was placed for sale. Former Major League Baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth formed the Clint Eastwood Investment Group. Richard Ferris, the former CEO of United Airlines, has also joined them.</p><p>The three contributed $20 million for their portion of the venture and collected 132 private minority investors, including golf legend Arnold Palmer, who paid $10 million for his stake.&nbsp;Their ultimate bid price was $820 million, which was less than the opponents’ $1 billion offer. Despite this, Lone Cypress approved the sale, which completed in 1999, and the investment has quadrupled in value over the last two decades.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmabnJ67tXnEmqqtr5%2BksW66xK1ksKeiqbVuv8ClmKuxXZius7HEq2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-is-clint-eastwood-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maha-mohamed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maha-mohamed.html>Maha Mohamed- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bella-hadid-wedgie-bikini-miami-pics-photos.html>Bella Hadid Gets A Wedgie While Wearing A Bikini In Miami Pics Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bella-hadid-wedgie-bikini-miami-pics-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

<time>27 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jaiden Animations is famous for story-time animation videos that touch on&nbsp;various topics and her personal experiences.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The animator has massed almost 11 million subscribers and over 1.9 billion views.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she has <a href=# rel=follow>revealed her face</a> to her online fans before, Jaiden is keen on keeping her privacy and rarely talks about herself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But on March 20, she surprised fans when she uploaded the video ‘Being Not Straight.’</p><p></p><p><strong>Jaiden Animations on being an Aroace</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Source:&nbsp;Jaiden Animations/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the video, she opened up about her sexuality as an aroace and her dating experience.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jaiden Animations on Her Sexuality and Relationships</h2><p>Jaiden shared that she was an aroace, an&nbsp;aromantic asexual, which was not the same as being gay.&nbsp;</p><p>She said that aromatic and asexual were two different things and broke down what those two meant.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Starting with aromatic, she defined it as “someone who feels very little to no romantic attraction to anyone.”</p><p>These people do not develop crushes or feel the need to be in a romantic relationship with anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>As an example, she recounted her experiences, claiming that she never had crushes growing up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I remember in fifth grade when kids were talking about their crushes left and right and it felt like something I had to experience too,” said Jaiden.</p><p>After that, she decided she needed to have a crush and randomly chose a kid in class, whom they called Pikachu.</p><p>Pikachu meant nothing to the animator, but having that crush made her feel normal.&nbsp;</p><p>She went through her school years never being attracted to anyone, and by the time college rolled around, she felt like she had to have a <a href=# rel=follow>boyfriend</a> to ensure she was not getting left behind.</p><h2>Jaiden Animations Discovers She Is Aroace</h2><p>In college, she met someone she found cool and wanted to spend every moment with them.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, Jaiden thought she had developed her first crush, but looking back now, she realized she had felt nothing romantic towards that person.&nbsp;</p><p>The YouTuber never really understood why she was feeling the way she did, and for the longest time, she thought she was a pansexual or a bisexual.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But she had to learn consciously on her own that she was aromantic.&nbsp;</p><p>And on her journey to self-discovery, she also realized that she was asexual.&nbsp;</p><p>Asexual people do not feel a sexual attraction towards others, and as Jaiden mentioned, she was never blown away by someone’s physicality.&nbsp;</p><p>She then learned that she was aroace, someone who was both asexual and aromantic, and claimed that while most people felt broken about being one, she felt the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think aroace is one of, if not the coolest and most confident LGBTQ orientations out there. Not needing a single gram of romantic or intimate validation from anyone is so cool. All you need is yourself to be happy,” said Jaiden.&nbsp;</p><p>But despite feeling cool and confident about it, she acknowledged that she felt lonely because she could not relate to anyone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said that romance was taught as a basic assumed emotion and that romance and intimacy made people human.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the YouTuber disagreed and said that basic empathy made people human.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRnrGmuoyapaKlkam2sLrSZpuarJmjtG6t0aiYnJ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjaiden-animations-dating-aroace-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sniper-j0ness-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sniper-j0ness-girlfriend-list.html>Sniper J0ness Girlfriend: Who is Sniper J0nes Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./teen-wolf-season-finale-jackson-werewolf-pics-recap.html>Jackson Becomes A Werewolf PICS Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./teen-wolf-season-finale-jackson-werewolf-pics-recap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

She can take a fair step forward.</p><p>Unbreak My Heart showed promise when winning at Bath. She didn’t have a lot to beat but did it nicely and this step up in distance should suit.</p><p>What A Question went from the front to win by almost five lengths at Goodwood on debut. She looks a strong stayer and can build on that good start.</p><p>Denruth Diamond liked give in the ground when winning in France and has a solid each-way chance, especially if there is still some juice in the ground. She is proven over this distance.</p><p>1.15</p><p>NEW LONDON hasn’t run since his excellent second in last year’s St Leger.</p><p>He has winning form over this slightly shorter distance and will be hard to beat if close to fitness.</p><p>His best efforts have come on quick ground but he goes on easier conditions too.</p><p>His main danger Al Aasy is also coming back from a long break. His last act was to win a Listed race at Ascot over this trip last May. He has been placed at Group 1 level and handles any ground.</p><p>William Haggas is more than capable of getting one fit at home and he should do himself justice.</p><p>Should the big two in the betting lack fitness, Phantom Flight could be the one to cash in.</p><p>He finished with lots left in the tank when third in a Goodwood Listed contest over 1m2f and should see out this longer distance. He is capable of scoring in this class.</p><p>Kemari did well in Dubai this spring with a couple of placed efforts in Group races.</p><p>He is a proven stayer who can do better than his rusty effort at Newbury in May.</p><p>1.50</p><p>BERKSHIRE SHADOW ran well in the Group 1 Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot and will enjoy this drop in class.</p><p>He went close in the Lockinge too and dropping back a furlong will do him no harm.</p><p>Aldaary needs a bit of cut in the ground as he showed when winning a couple of hot handicaps in 2021 before a Listed win the following May.</p><p>He’s been off 420 days, which is clearly an issue, but William Haggas will have him fit enough to perform and he can’t be ruled out.</p><p>Audience signed off last season with an easy handicap win over this trip at Leicester.</p><p>It’s a concern that we are only seeing him now but he looks capable of holding his own at this level.</p><p>Pogo won this race 12 months ago and has been running in higher-class contests ever since.</p><p>He found the Queen Anne a bit much over a mile last time and will be much happier dropping to this specialist trip where he has done all his winning.</p><p>Jumby won a Haydock Group 3 with a bit up his sleeve 21 days ago and this is his favourite distance.</p><p>Quicker ground would be ideal but he’s in the mix. Sam Maximus faces a tall order with his best coming over a shorter trip.</p><p>NEWCASTLE</p><p>12.20</p><p>LETHAL LEVI got no luck when beaten a fair six lengths in the Wokingham at Ascot after a narrow Ayr second.</p><p>He’ll be hard to beat if he handles the surface on his all-weather debut.</p><p>Raatea won this 12 months ago and arrives on the back of a battling win at Haydock. He’s 5lb higher this year but has every chance.</p><p>Soldier’s Minute got no luck in running when fourth at York latest and is dangerous.</p><p>Coachello won a Listed race in Dubai in winter and drops in class after a poor Curragh effort.</p><p>12.55</p><p>SPYCATCHER has been better than ever this season with a Thirsk win followed by a good fourth in a big Ascot handicap.</p><p>He has run well over trip and track before so can go close again.</p><p>Brad The Brief is fragile but has won first-time-out three times and has a Group 2 prize on his CV over this trip. He has won on the all-weather before.</p><p>Witch Hunter pulled off a 50-1 shock at Royal Ascot lst week over an extra furlong.</p><p>That’s good form and he could take another step forward at a track he likes.</p><p>Mount Athos is consistent and has had a wind op since his Thirsk second. He needs to improve over this shorter trip.</p><p>Tiber Flow can’t be dismissed after his Haydock second and he’s won here before.</p><p>1.30</p><p>BLOW YOUR HORN has been in brilliant form and made it four wins in a row at Pontefract on Sunday.</p><p>He has won after a short break before, likes it here and is a strong stayer.</p><p>Appier will be a big danger if he stays after some good efforts over 1m4f. He handles the track and scored handily at Lingfield latest.</p><p>Citizen General is consistent and was second here before two good Lingfield runs.</p><p>He shapes like a stayer and the first-time cheekpieces could help him get home.</p><p>Thermoscope likes this trip and has won here before. He’s a threat, while Faylaq has looked more like it this season and could hit the frame.</p><p>2.05</p><p>VINO VICTRIX will be fitter for his two runs this season on soft ground that doesn’t suit.</p><p>He was an excellent second in the Cesarewitch last season so loves this trip and is on a fair weight. He can go close at a big price.</p><p>Post Impressionist is on the up after winning a nice prize over 1m6f at York. He can cope with an 8lb rise in the handicap.</p><p>Sir Mark Prescott is respected with his Omniscient who will relish this longer distance.</p><p>Adjuvant had a bit up his sleeve when scoring at Newmarket and is a threat.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Law Of The Sea has each-way claims given his staying power and liking for a big field.</p><p>Rajinsky is consistent and has run well in this before so is on the shortlist.</p><h2>Templegate's tips</h2><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.

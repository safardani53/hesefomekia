They do an outstanding job and enable us to compete. However, I am sad tonight since, shortly after finishing my long jump competition at the English Championships, one of the female officials felt compelled to notify me that my spirit briefs were too short and unsuitable. I was rendered dumbfounded. I’ve been wearing the same spring briefs for many years, and they’re specifically intended for competition. Hopefully, I’ll be wearing them in Tokyo. It made me wonder if a male rival would be treated similarly. I hope no other female athletes experienced similar difficulties. I see the necessity for standards and norms for competition attire, but women should not be made to feel self-conscious about what they wear when competing, but rather should feel comfortable and at ease.”</p><h2>Olivia Breen Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Olivia Breen</strong> earns a living as a professional athlete, Her earnings are derived from contracts, prize money, and endorsements.

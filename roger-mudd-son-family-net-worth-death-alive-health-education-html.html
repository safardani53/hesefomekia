Doing that, he served for various national channels such as NBC, PBS, CBS, and the History Channel. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His work had earned him several awards and accolades, including five 'Emmy Awards,' 'Joan Shorenstein Award' for Distinguished Washington Reporting, and the 'Peabody Award.'</p><p>Today, Mudd, who experienced success and received love for his work, is no more with us — he passed away on March 9, 2021.</p><h2>Died at the Age of 93</h2><p>The renowned broadcast journalist passed away due to complications from kidney failure at his residence in McLean, Virginia, on March 9, 2021, at the age of 93. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His death saddened many of his family members, friends, audiences, and colleagues. “Roger was a hero in the CBS News Washington bureau,” the president and senior executive producer of CBS News, Susan Zirinsky,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> on Mudd’s death.</p><p>Zirinsky added, “He was a journalist of enormous integrity and character. He would not budge if he believed he was right and would not compromise his ethical standards. He was an inspiration to all of us in the bureau.”</p><p>On a personal note — I sat directly across from him in the D.C. newsroom — Roger was big, not just in his physical presence but he was larger than life.</p><p>Besides, many fans and media houses took to their social media to share their heartfelt condolences towards Mudd and his family members.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Roger Mudd was a journalist of the highest standard. His storied career was a credit to his talent and a service to the country. The crucible of newsrooms can be competitive, but I always admired Roger.

We met him at The Homestead years ago, and he and my husband played a round of golf. They attended the same university. He interviewed Bobby Kennedy right before he was assassinated.

He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated</a> with a B.A. degree from Washington and Lee University and received an M.A. degree from the University of North Carolina in 1950. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Relationship with His Wife Emma and Her Death&nbsp;</h2><p>To be exactly precise, it was during his days at radio station WTOP in Washington when he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> his wife, Emma Jeanne Spears Mudd.</p><p>The couple dated for a brief period and later got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> in 1987. What's more, the couple had a lovely family of three sons, Daniel, Jonathan, and Matthew, and a daughter, Maria.</p><p>In his book 'The Place to Be,' released in 2009, Roger described his wife as the vital cog that held on the family together when he was not available. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>YOU MAY LIKE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Sharna Burgess' Boyfriend & Husband To Be; Bobby Bones Or Someone Else?</a></strong></p><p>The vital cog in the family, Emma, however, was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">taken away</a> from the Mudd family in 2011. She suffered a heart attack in May 2011, and her health worsened with every passing day. The heart attack turned out to be the cause of her death in July 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mudd couple had been married for more than 60 years, and the death of Emma resulted in the loss of support for Roger. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Death of Emma Didn’t Impede the Growth of Sons and Daughter</h2><p>Despite the death of Emma, her son Daniel <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">continued</a> to excel in his role of business personality while the middle son, Jonathan, excelled in his music career. The career of the other two children of the Mudd couple also hit newer heights.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Roger was involved in philanthropic works and was fulfilling his role as a Trustee of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges.</p><h2>Mudd’s Professional Career and His Net Worth</h2><p>Mudd started his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a> in journalism by serving as a reporter for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. After his term at the paper, he joined WTOP News, a DC-based TV channel, as a reporter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Climbing up the ladder quickly, Mudd was already an anchor for the network before joining the National Broadcaster CBS Washington in 1961.</p><p>At CBS,&nbsp;he covered Congress and national politics and often subbed for Walter Cronkite until 1981.

After his brief stint on PBS, he also worked for Academia and The History Channel in the late 1990s before retiring in 2004.</p><p>His broadcasting journey was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filled</a> with memorable moments, including the famous interview with US Presidential Candidate Ted Kennedy. His abrasive questioning led to a mockery of Ted, which led to his defeat by Jim Carter for the president.</p><p>It's not just name and fame that the broadcaster&nbsp;earned during his time, as he was consistently one of the best-paid broadcasters until his retirement. Despite the exact figure remaining obscure, his net worth was reported to be in millions.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e8qLHRZqSunJRiwLC6jJ%2BYpqGcrnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16pbHArZ9mmZyew6Z5x56YpayYYrKlwcKaq6KnnmO1tbnL</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froger-mudd-son-family-net-worth-death-alive-health-education-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meghan-markle-prince-harry-we-lied-about-the-beginning-of-our-relationship-heres-how-we-really-met.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meghan-markle-prince-harry-we-lied-about-the-beginning-of-our-relationship-heres-how-we-really-met.html>We Lied Before, Here's How We REALLY Met!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jaden-dunns-girlfriend-list.html>Jaden Dunns Girlfriend: Who is Jaden Dunn Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jaden-dunns-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

So that I could kill him."</p><p>Liam, who has come under fire for his comments, said during the interview with the&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel data-vars-item-name=BL-8760866-http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/liam-neeson-interview-rape-race-black-man-revenge-taken-cold-pursuit-a8760896.html data-vars-event-id=c6>Independent</a> that&nbsp;his behaviour was "awful" and it took him more than a week to calm down.</p><p>"It was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that," he said. "And I’ve never admitted that, and I’m saying it to a journalist. God forbid."</p><p>He added: "It’s awful. But I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, ‘What the f*** are you doing’, you know?"</p><p>In response to the interview Liam has been branded racist by fans amid a massive backlash online.</p><p>"Wow so Liam Neeson is f*****g cancelled. So if the guy was white you'd go stalking the streets to find a random, unrelated white person to kill? Scumbag," one outraged reader tweeted.</p><p>Another added: "That Liam Neeson interview is just so saddening (and yes, still racist). It reinforces the idea that people of colour, and especially black men, are collectively responsible for the misdeeds of one. And that when a woman is sexually violated, it's a man who is left truly wounded."</p><p>Another reader wrote: "Honestly dunno how I feel about that Liam Neeson article."</p><p>On January 5, on Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan slammed Liam for his comments.</p><p>And on the same day the New York premiere for his film Cold Pursuit was cancelled after the controversy.</p><p>And there have even been calls for the Irishman's scenes in the new Men In Black movie to be culled.</p><p>Neeson has cancelled an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert amid controversy over his “black b*****d” comments.</p><p>The Irish actor, 66, was due to appear on the US chat show on Friday, as he promotes his latest film Cold Pursuit.</p><p>However, on the listings for upcoming guests on the programme, Neeson has been replaced by&nbsp;The Wife actress Glenn Close.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000001581468.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in TV&Showbiz</h2></p><h2>Who was Liam's wife Natasha Richardson?</h2><p>Liam met his late wife, actress Natasha Richardson, while performing in a revival of the play Anna Christie on Broadway in 1993 and they married on July 3, 1994.</p><p>But on March 18, 2009, tragedy struck when Natasha died when she suffered a severe head injury in a skiing accident in Montreal, Canada.</p><p>The couple had two sons together, Micheál Richard Antonio (born 1995) and Daniel Jack (born 1996).</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Teaser trailer The Commuter starring Liam Neeson and Vera Farmiga</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZW2GeYWUaKOimZ1iu6ax0qilZpmXmnq4tcWeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliam-neeson-age-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ricky-garard-19940515-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ricky-garard-19940515-html.html>Ricky Garard (Bodybuilder) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./arslan-goni.html>Fame | Arslan Goni net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./arslan-goni.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

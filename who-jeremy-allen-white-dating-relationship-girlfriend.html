"</p><p>"We have a nice foundation from being friends for a long period of time, and then it took a hard right turn into romance."</p><p>Timlin starred alongside White in the 2008 film Afterschool when they were each just 17 years old.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Jeremy ">Read More on Jeremy</h2><p>Since then, Timlin has gone on to act in multiple <a href=#>TV</a> shows and movies, including That Awkward Moment, Californication, <a href=#>Law & Order,</a> and <a href=#>American Horror Stories</a>.</p><p>The duo dated for a few years, and <a href=#>welcomed daughter Ezer</a> in October 2018.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>tied the knot</a> a year later in a <a href=#>courthouse wedding</a> on October 18, 2019.</p><p>Timlin and White kept their <a href=#>romance</a> under wraps for the most part, besides the occasional <a href=#>social media</a> snap.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>On June 29, 2020, Timlin posted a photo of the duo and their daughter on <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p><p>She captioned the post: "I'm so grateful for my 28th year. I married my best friend of 15 years, who happens to be the love of my life."</p><p>"We have the coolest kid in the world who reveals herself to be a true weird like her parents more and more every day."</p><p>In December 2020, the couple welcomed another daughter, Dolores.</p><p>After winning a <a href=#>Golden Globe Award</a> in January 2023, White gave his wife a shoutout during his speech, saying: "I love you deep in my bones, thank you for all that you do, thank you for everything that you've done."</p><p>Just months later, Timlin filed for <a href=#>divorce</a> in May 2023.</p><p>Since then, the couple have been spotted together a few times, but they've both confirmed they're just <a href=#>co-parenting</a>.</p><p>White and Timlin have agreed to share joint custody of their children, but only under the stipulation that White submits to <a href=#>alcohol</a> testing and monitoring, and attends weekly therapy and <a href=#>AA meetings</a>.</p><p>It is unclear whether Timlin has moved on since calling it quits with White, or if she's focusing exclusively on <a href=#>her children</a> at this time.</p><p>Before his relationship with Timlin, White was briefly linked to his <a href=#>Shameless</a> costar, Emma Greenwell.</p><p>The duo played boyfriend-girlfriend on the <a href=#>Showtime</a> series.</p><p>Besides appearing alongside each other at a few <a href=#>entertainment</a> events, the duo kept their relationship relatively private.</p><p>It's unclear when and why the two broke things off, but White's last appearance on Greenwell's <a href=#>Instagram</a> page was in 2014, shortly after he started dating Timlin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Jeremy Allen White in a relationship?</h2><p>Following his May 2023 divorce, <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White</a> kept a relatively low profile.</p><p>He was likely <a href=#>busy filming</a> the upcoming A24 biographical <a href=#>sports</a> drama, <a href=#>The Iron Claw</a>, based on the life of <a href=#>professional wrestler</a> Kevin Von Erich and the <a href=#>Von Erich family</a>.</p><p>White stars alongside <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>, <a href=#>Lily James</a>, <a href=#>Harris Dickinson</a>, Maura Tierney, and Holt McCallany.</p><p>In July 2023, gossip site Deux Moi received an anonymous tip claiming "a recently separated Golden Globe winner....met this A-List singer-actress during a cover shoot for Vanity Fair."</p><p>Fans speculated that <a href=#>the blind item</a> was about White and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, but neither party responded to the rumors.</p><p>White did get the paparazzi's attention in August 2023, when he was spotted with actress and model <a href=#>Ashley Moore</a> during a <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> outing.</p><p>On August 5, 2023, the duo were photographed kissing, hugging, and enjoying each other's company in a very public display of affection.</p><p>A source later told <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a> that despite the PDA, the duo weren't “putting any labels on their relationship, but they’re hooking up as often as they can.”</p><p>Moore was previously linked to actor <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a>, <a href=#>rapper</a> Lil Twist, and singer <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p>It's unclear how long the two were together, or when their label-less romance fizzled out, as White was spotted with a new woman just a few months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> spotted White and <a href=#>Rosalía</a> spending the day together at a Los Angeles farmer's market.</p><p>White was holding multiple bouquets, while the <a href=#>Spanish</a> singer-songwriter was holding a single, giant flower in her hand, likely a gift from her new beau.</p><p>White and <a href=#>Rosalía</a> were also spotted taking a <a href=#>smoke break</a> together on Wednesday, November 29, 2023.</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ </a>snapped photos of the pair facing each other with their feet touching.</p><p>A source reportedly told <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a>: “Rosalía and Jeremy Allen White have recently started dating."</p><p>The source added: “They started out as just friends, but things have turned romantic recently.”</p><p>Neither White nor the Chicken Teriyaki singer have commented on or confirmed their rumored romance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can I watch The Bear?</h2><p>Jeremy Allen White may be known for his breakout role as Phillip "Lip" Gallagher on the hit <a href=#>Showtime</a> television show, <a href=#>Shameless</a>, but the actor shot to fame in another series, too.</p><p>The Bear premiered on <a href=#>Hulu</a> on June 23, 2022.</p><p>It is produced by FX Productions, an in-house production company owned by <a href=#>FX Networks</a>.</p><p>The show's second season was released one year later, on June 22, 2023.</p><p>The comedy-drama series follows Jeremy Allen White as a

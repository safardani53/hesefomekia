Some of them ask for taxis to Middlesbrough.</p><p>"I don't get worried about answering the door, I just have to politely<br>decline."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Denise admits the sirens and ambulances were "daunting" when she moved in 13 years ago, but within six months she got settled.</p><p>Locals quickly warned her about the potential threat to her then-nine-year-old daughter.</p><p>She recalled: "My neighbour said to keep her inside when it was visiting hours because paedophiles visit paedophiles and rapists visit rapists.</p><p>"So she wasn't allowed out of the house until she was 14. It was a shock to hear."</p><p>Denise doesn't worry for her safety even when former convicts knock on her door because she claims killers are released in a different way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/newspress-collage-20183840-1666363569576.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1995-murdering-10-young-women-639477918.jpg><p>However, at times, residents are instructed to stay indoors for their safety.</p><p>Denise said: "You see convoys going past when high-profile prisoners arrive. They stop you from leaving your home but once it's cleared, you carry on with normal life.</p><p>"Sometimes when there's a big case, there are journalists filming outside. I turned the TV on once and thought 'that's my house.'"</p><p>The jail shares the same sprawling complex as HMP Frankland, one of the toughest male prisons in the UK.</p><p>The Category A penitentiary lodges notorious criminals such as killer <a href=#>Levi Bellfield</a> and murderer <a href=#>Wayne Couzens</a> and was once home to violent prisoners <a href=#>Charles Bronson</a> and <a href=#>Peter Sutcliffe</a>, who murdered 13 women.</p><p>Frankland opened in 1980 with only four wings with 108 cells in each, but grew in 1998 when a further two wings were opened – it now has eight wings and houses approximately 850 men.</p><h2>Clothes pinched off washing line</h2><p>Housewife Sharon Wheatley, 50, has always lived her entire life in the area and insists she has "never felt frightened".</p><p>She said: "Some people ask if I've ever seen anyone escape, but I haven't.</p><p>"Even if someone does escape, they don't stay around here. They'll run off into the farmland, especially over at Frankland."</p><p>One surprising misfortune she did experience was some of her belongings vanishing.</p><p>Sharon explained: "Years ago people who visited the young offender institute would pinch stuff off your washing line.</p><p>"It was never the prisoners, just their friends and family. But now, there are no issues. I feel incredibly safe."</p><p>Sharon says it's easy to spot when a prisoner is about to be released because "there are protesters outside".</p><p>She adds: "There's nobody innocent in there, it's reserved for the worst of the worst."</p><p>The mum-of-one claims it's like living anywhere else and her main gripe is "the volume of traffic".</p><p>"It's the number of workers that travel there – you can't get across the road at seven in the morning."</p><h2>Struggle to sell home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/e0550b18-9f29-47ed-bdea-57c970e78ec8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19444edc-123a-4dfa-babc-55df51f9626b.jpg><p>Steven Nixon built his four-bedroom home, which is three doors away from HMP Frankland, in 2005.</p><p>But now, the 56-year-old bricklayer is struggling to flog the property, which is priced at £450,000, because of its close proximity to the prison.</p><p>He said: "The home is up for sale but I've had a few buyers lose interest because they're worried about the prison.</p><p>"Some say, 'What about the people who come to visit?' But, you never hear anything, it's really safe."</p><p>Steven lives so close to the secure prison that it is visible from his back garden.</p><p>"You can't see it if you sit at the bottom of the garden next to the shed," he added.</p><p>"It's the best place to live, I would give it a ten out of ten. I bought the land because I thought it was a great location, it's a lovely area.</p><p>"The only reason I'm moving is that I want to downsize but there's<br>nothing to be afraid of. It's the safest place to be."</p><h2>'People try to scare you away'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4afe6abc-a55f-4507-9768-89351dc9e8bc.jpg><p>An elderly resident, who didn't want to be named, has spent her whole life in the area and was there before the prisons were built.</p><p>She said: "I remember when it was all fields and farmland, there were only 30 houses. It was very quiet.</p><p>"When they announced they were building the prisons it was a bit scary but we weren't petrified.</p><p>"Some of the older people in the street would try and scare you but it was interesting, it was something different.</p><p>"I used to work there as a cleaner and my husband was an officer in<br>Frankland. It was the best job I ever had, I loved it."</p><h2>'Traffic is bad but it's very safe'</h2><p>Full-time carer Maz Aghdam, 49, who has lived in the street for seven years, says the area is "very safe" and he's "really happy" living there.</p><p>He said: "A lot of people go for walks around here.

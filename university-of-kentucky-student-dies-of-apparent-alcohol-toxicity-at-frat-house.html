Coroner officials also listed the manner of death as an accident, per the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement to PEOPLE, Christian Wiggins, the CEO of the FarmHouse Fraternity, said of the incident: "We are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Thomas 'Lofton' Hazelwood, a new member of the University of Kentucky chapter of FarmHouse Fraternity. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and loved ones as well as the entire community. We have encouraged all members and new members to cooperate with any investigation prompted by Mr. Hazelwood's death."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A spokesperson for the Fayette County Coroner's Office did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Grieving Parents of FSU Student Who Died of Alcohol Poisoning Push for Anti-Hazing Law</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the wake of his death, UK's President Eli Capilouto and UK Vice President for Student Success Kirsten Turner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>issued a letter to the campus community</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the note, they referred to Hazelwood's death as "a tragic loss" and mentioned how the teen "was a new member of his fraternity" who was "involved in campus activities and... loved by his family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In other words, he had all the promise of youth and the potential that comes with it," the letter read. "There aren't words adequate to convey what so many on our campus feel, the sense of loss and grief, sadness and emptiness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hazelwood's mom, Tracey, later spoke with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lexington Herald-Leader</a> and said her son was the youngest of four siblings who became interested in agriculture after working a summer job on a farm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was an old soul," Tracey told the outlet. "Such a good boy. Loved his family and friends... He was a great, great kid."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Capilouto and Turner's note, they vowed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>find out what happened</a> to Hazelwood, noting that an investigation has already been launched by the police.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have conveyed to Lofton's family that we will move as quickly as possible, but also transparently and comprehensively. We won't speculate or engage in conjecture, but we will find out," they wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the investigation is ongoing, Capilouto and Turner said they were suspending all activities for the FarmHouse Fraternity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Life is fragile and precious. Too often, we realize that far too late," Capilouto and Turner wrote. "So, while we cannot heal such a loss or fill the emptiness that we know so many feel right now, we can be there for each other a little more tomorrow than we are today, and we can commit to finding answers. That is the project, as a community, that we will undertake together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Visitation hours are scheduled from 2 to 8 p.m. on Friday and 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturday at Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church, according to the Herald-Leader. A funeral for Hazelwood is expected to follow at noon on Saturday at the church, per the outlet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e9SnoK%2Bdoqi2tcWMqJ1mo5WjwbavyrJkrKylmbKvwIydoJ6rXaSzbq3PqZirnZ6peqK4wqifqKRdqby5tcKiq7Jlkal6p77ArWShp6WosnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2funiversity-of-kentucky-student-dies-of-apparent-alcohol-toxicity-at-frat-house.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alex-gidewon-19730710-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alex-gidewon-19730710-html.html>Alex Gidewon (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-twilight-zone-classic.html>Stream live TV, Movies, Originals, News, and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-twilight-zone-classic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

<time>13 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>PANERA has created several innovative menu items over the years, but some fans of the fast casual restaurant have been heartbroken to see their favorites disappear.</p><p><a href=#>Panera</a> first got its start in 1987 as a unique alternative to the less healthy <a href=#>fast food</a> Americans had available.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/customer-sits-outside-panera-bread-820811104.jpg><p>It quickly rose to prominence across the country for its salads, soups, and sandwiches.</p><p>While Panera still offers a wide range of both light and hearty options for lunch or breakfast, customers have been missing four beloved items.</p><p>Menu entrees get discontinued for various reasons at restaurants all the time.</p><p>Sometimes stores get rid of products to simplify their menus if an item is more difficult to make, and this happened often during the <a href=#>pandemic</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about Panera">Read more about Panera</h2><p>Customer complaints and supply chain issues can also get an entree booted from the menu.</p><p>However, most of the time, low sales performance is the ultimate reason why your favorite menu item got removed.</p><p>Here’s the full list of discontinued Panera menu items as some customers hold out on hope they could make a comeback.</p><h2>1. SIERRA TURKEY SANDWICH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/www-zmenu-com-panera-bread-824991622.jpg><p>Nothing hits for your lunchtime meal quite like a classic turkey sandwich.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Customers loved the Sierra Turkey Sandwich, which contained turkey breast, field greens, Asiago cheese focaccia, red onions, and chipotle mayo.</p><p>The sandwich was served warm and paired well with chips or an apple as a side.</p><p>While customers saw this as one of Panera’s most popular items, the chain ended up giving the sandwich the boot after trying to switch up its recipe.</p><p>When the Sierra Turkey Sandwich replaced its sauce and bread, sandwich sales went downhill fast.</p><p>The restaurant now sells a basic deli turkey sandwich, many Panera fans said it wasn't the same.</p><p>One Reddit user shared: "Sierra Turkey. Please come back. I love you."</p><h2>2. BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/www-thedailymeal-com-1306305-824991618.jpg><p>While Panera may not be known for its pasta, there was a time when you could delight in butternut squash ravioli at any Panera restaurant.</p><p>The dish, which was served with plenty of sauce and cheese, was prominent during the mid 2000s, and it became especially popular during the fall months.</p><p>Part of the issue that may have led Panera to discontinue the item was not in its flavor, but instead in its serving size.</p><p>Customers routinely complained that the dish was overpriced and didn’t fill them up enough for such a high cost.</p><p>One customer went as far as to say the ravioli was a “rip off” on Trip Advisor.</p><p>“The shock was how small the portion was. I literally got six raviolis. Just regular fairly flat pieces for $8.39. Now I realize $8.39 is not a lot of money but it seems high compared to their other lunch deals they offer.”</p><p>Despite this, many fans still want the ravioli back.</p><p>“Why have you not brought this back? I demand squash pasta!” one customer wrote on Facebook.</p><h2>3. CHIPOTLE CHICKEN PANINI</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/100069211275838-824991721.jpg><p>Another Panera fan favorite that was gone too soon was the Chipotle Chicken Panini.</p><p>The sandwich was filled with a special chipotle sauce on top of chicken, bacon, and spicy melted cheese on toasted panini bread.</p><p>When the menu item mysteriously disappeared in 2015, even die-hard Panera fans were shocked.</p><p>To deal with the aftermath, some customers even created t-shirts reading “The light has gone out of my life... #BringBacktheChipotleChickenPanini” alongside an image of the fallen sandwich.</p><p>While Panera has since introduced a Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt, fans don’t think it can compare to the original panini.</p><p>“Craving this for lunch today, but Panera hasn't brought it back on their menu. Sign the <a href=#>petition,</a> maybe they can hear the customers' wants!” one user wrote on Facebook.</p><p>Subsequently, the petition read:&nbsp;</p><p>“It is our right as customers to choose a healthy meal on the menu, not have our favorite panini removed from it. A lot of restaurants are choosing to remove fattening meals from their menu, however when we choose to go out to eat, we want to have our favorite greasy meals."</p><p>It continued: "It is good to have healthy meal options added in fast food restaurant chains, however our old-time favorites should NOT be VANISHED.”</p><h2>4. RED VELVET CRINKLE COOKIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/https-www-facebook-com-panerabread-824991621.jpg><p>Beyond Panera’s lunchtime salad bowls and sandwich staples, the chain has garnered quite a reputation for its delicious baked goods.</p><p>The Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies first made an appearance in 2012 during the holiday season.</p><p>The chain described the item as a “soft, brownie-like cookie based on the traditional red velvet cake with a chocolate undertone, containing cream cheese flavored chips throughout and rolled in powdered sugar.”</p><p>The soft cookies had a gooey, rich base that reminded customers of a traditional red velvet cake.</p><p>It disappeared as quickly as it first appeared as the restaurant made room for other cookie offerings.</p><p>When the cookie first came out, Panera customers were ecstatic, and many wish the sweet was still around today.</p><p>“This cookie is perfection and simply delicious, hope it remains on the menu even after the holidays have passed!” one fan shared on Facebook.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Customers are also begging Pepsi to bring back an <a href=#>iconic soda flavor.</a></p><p>Plus, shoppers are hoping a <a href=#>Spiderman-themed popsicle</a> could make a comeback soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYB3hJVpaGiokaOys62MnaCsm5%2Bjwaq61J6bZp6fpLFutdOepKxn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpanera-discontinued-food-items.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./man-utd-swap-transfer-barcelona-jadon-sancho-raphinha.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./man-utd-swap-transfer-barcelona-jadon-sancho-raphinha.html>Man Utd 'want controversial swap transfer for former Leeds star' in bid to offload Jadon Sancho</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andrew-bellatti.html>Fame | Andrew Bellatti net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./andrew-bellatti.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

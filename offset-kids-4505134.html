The rapper (whose real name is&nbsp;<strong>Kiari Kendall Cephus</strong>) is a great dad, expertly balancing his music career with his kiddos. And with four different baby-mamas, there are definitely more family dynamics to consider than for most. Offset shares <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two of his children</a> with wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cardi</strong> <strong>B</strong></a>, 30, while his other older three are from previous relationships.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The <strong>Migos</strong> rapper has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>praised his wife</a> for supporting all of his children. He told Essence in Apr. 2022, “It’s a blessing to be able to have them all together and to have a wife who’s open and treats them as if they’re her kids. It could be an issue, but I don’t have to go through that, and that’s beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Besides showing his fatherly love, the rapper even named his debut solo album in honor of all of his kids. The 2019 album was called Father of Four, and its cover featured Offset sitting on a throne with all of his children by his sides. So sweet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ready to learn more about Offset’s kids? Look no further!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/offset-kids-cardi-b-kulture-embed1.jpg><h2>Jordan Cephus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Offset’s oldest child is his son&nbsp;<strong>Jordan,</strong> 12, who he had with a woman named <strong>Justine Watson</strong>. Jordan’s mom tried to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sue the rapper</a> for retroactive child support and $15,000 in legal fees in 2017, claiming that he was a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>deadbeat dad</a>. Offset admitted that he was Jordan’s daddy, but he fought back on the accusations that he wasn’t there for his son, asking for joint custody of Jordan. In the years since the rapper seemed to have sorted things out with Jordan’s mom, and he’s posted adorable photos of his oldest on Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Migos rapper admitted his first experience in fatherhood wasn’t perfect. “The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>journey of fatherhood</a> was kind of tough for me at first,” Offset told Haute Living in February of 2019. “I was trying to find myself. I didn’t have much direction on what it meant to be a father. I definitely made some mistakes, but I have no regrets. It’s challenging when you have a career like this and you’re constantly on the road. It makes it tough to see your kids, especially when they’re young. Now that I’m older, though, I’m learning my way.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He also reflected on his relationship with his firstborn on the 2019 track <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Father Of Four.”</a> In it, he raps, “I was seventeen years old when I had you, Tryna find my soul when I had you. I was oh so broke when I had you, Locked up down the road when I had you Jordan, sorry I wasn’t there for all your birthdays.”</p><h2>Kody Cephus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2015, Offset had his second son&nbsp;<strong>Kody</strong>, 7, with a woman named&nbsp;<strong>Oriel Jamie.&nbsp;</strong>After Offset got engaged to Cardi, Oriel sent the couple a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shady message</a> on SnapChat. “Congrats to my son daddy and his stepmother whom he has yet to meet,” she wrote. “Hopefully he at least gets an invite to the wedding.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Things appear to have worked out for the family since. Both Offset and Cardi love sharing photos of their blended family online.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Offset revealed how he went the extra mile to attend Kody’s very <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first football game</a> in Sep. 2022. He dropped a whopping <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>five figures</a> for a private jet to the game, telling his Twitter followers, “Spent 50k on jet to make Kody first football game ……can’t miss these moments.”</p><h2>Kalea Marie Cephus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Offset’s first little girl, who is 7, was with another female rapper, <strong>Shya L’Amour.</strong> Offset shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet Instagram</a> post in March to celebrate&nbsp;<strong>Kalea’s&nbsp;</strong>sixth birthday. “You are my beautiful little Queen your heart is full of joy and happiness I love you with all my heart,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Offset says he had trouble learning about Kalea at first. Talking to Power 105.1’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Breakfast Club</a> in Feb. 2019, he admitted, “That was one of the hardest moments in my life to be honest. I was hearing I had a kid. Then when I see the kid I know it’s me. But she’s five months and I don’t even know her. This my first daughter. But even before making sure, I knew. And she’s so beautiful I couldn’t even do her like that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Shya revealed that Kalea and her daddy have a great relationship in a March 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. “She loves him, they’re really good now, he has stepped up and he has been around as of lately to show her that affection she needs, that parental love. A mother can’t do that for a father,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Shya was also complimentary to her ex’s new wife. “I think [Cardi’s] helped him grow tremendously,” she said. “Since he’s been with her, he’s definitely—I’ve seen a lot of growth.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Offset rapped about his eldest daughter on Father Of Four as well. Talking about the memories he missed, he rapped, “Kalea you was my first, first daughter. I missed the first years of your life, I’m sorry. Tell the truth I ain’t really know if I was your father.”</p><h2>Kulture Kiari Cephus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>The rapper’s daughter <strong>Kulture,</strong> 4, was his first with his wife, Cardi. She was born July 10, 2018, which the rap queen announced <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on her Instagram</a> at the time. Keeping the message simple, she shared, “Kulture Kiari Cephus 07/10/18” and tagged Offset.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Now that Kulture’s a bit bigger, she’s totally taken after her parents’ stylish ways. The toddler, who has over 2.2million Instagram followers, regularly shows off matching looks with mom and dad on social media. Offset hasn’t held back on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoiling his girl</a> either. For her 4th birthday, the rapper actually gave Kulture $50k in cash.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>It turns out Kulture is a total <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Daddy’s Girl.”</a> Not only were some of her first words “Da da,” but she also gets blue when her pop is away on tour. Cardi opened up to E! News in Oct. 2018, explaining, “Sometimes she be throwing tantrums and I be telling Offset when he’s on tour, ‘Oh my God this girl be throwing the craziest tantrums.’ Then when he come around, she doesn’t do it.”</p><h2>Wave Set Cephus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Offset welcomed his 2nd child with wife Cardi B on Sep. 4, 2021, sharing a sweet photo of the star wrapped in a <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> blanket and cradling her little one from her hospital bed. Offset also posted a sweet candid photo of cuddling the baby boy. “Chapter 5,” he wrote in his caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>At the time, the couple shared their joy with <strong>HollywoodLife,</strong> telling the site, “We are so overjoyed to finally meet our son. He is already loved so much by family and friends and we can’t wait to introduce him to his other siblings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Cardi called Offset a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>very “hands-on”</a> father after Wave’s birth in 2021. “He is definitely hands-on,” Cardi B said during an interview with Good Morning America. “Sometimes he just gets too hands-on. I be like, ‘Listen, I got it. I know what I’m doing, too. This ain’t my first rodeo anymore.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>The parents were more private about Wave’s welcoming than their first baby. The parents <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>strategically avoided</a> sharing his face and his name until over 7 months after his birth, waiting for Apr. 2022 for the big reveal. Since, they haven’t stopped sharing cute shots of their youngest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme86fnaydpGK4qrDSZmtuaGVmgHV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2foffset-kids-4505134.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kimya-dawson-19721117-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kimya-dawson-19721117-html.html>Kimya Dawson (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stephanie-neely.html>Fame | Stephanie Neely net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stephanie-neely.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

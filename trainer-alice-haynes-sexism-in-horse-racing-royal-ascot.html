How does 89 winners and over £800,000 in prize-money in a little over two years sound?</p><p>And it has not gone unnoticed by the Newmarket establishment — a small number of whom haven’t taken too kindly to Haynes’ fast start.</p><p>She said: “We had to hit the ground running when we started out, it was so important.</p><p>“You can only win with what you’ve got and hope you attract big owners who will give you a break and send you more horses.</p><p>“Even now you overhear people saying ‘how did she get that horse’ or ‘how did she get that owner’. You need a thick skin.</p><p>“In general racing is &nbsp;a male-dominated sport and, unfortunately, a few people live up to the old negative stereotypes.</p><p>“There was an owner this year who decided to send their horses to other trainers because I am a girl, but that’s up to them.</p><p>“I’m&nbsp;better off not having people like that around the yard.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>“What those who have a shot at us don’t realise is we’ve put our blood, sweat and tears into the business to get to where we are now.</p><p>“We started with&nbsp;a handful of horses and have had nothing handed to us whatsoever.”</p><p>That was quite literally the case with regards a few of her former owners. Some chancers disappeared without paying their training fees, making a difficult job even harder.</p><p>She continued: “We have learnt the hard way, I have had some owners who haven’t paid the bills and left me up the creek without a paddle.</p><p>"It’s not what you want in your first couple of years when you are spending so much money trying to get going, especially during the pandemic.</p><p>“Though it is even tougher for a lot of yards now with the cost of living than it was then.</p><p>“Everything is &nbsp;more expensive than it was this time last year, so everyone is feeling the pinch.</p><p>“I am very lucky to have some good and supportive owners now and you keep hoping there will be a superstar around the corner.</p><p>“From where we started to where we are now, we have made great progress and have some lovely horses in the yard.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>You can say that again.</p><p>Her two-year-olds have come flying out of the traps and it is just a matter of time before she notches her first Royal Ascot winner. When she does there will no doubt be tears, what with her family home being a stone’s throw from the racecourse.</p><p>She is not a one-trick pony, though, and has several older horses lined up for some of the big-money handicaps.</p><p>But it does look as though her main hope heading into the biggest week of the Flat season will be Maximum Impact — the unbeaten colt owned by footy super agent Kia Joorabchian.</p><p>Haynes said: “He is a very smart horse. I’ve been thrilled with what he has done so far.</p><p>“He gave me my first winner at Ascot earlier this month which was very emotional as it’s where I grew up. It was lovely and my mum was there to support me.</p><p>“We’ll probably stick to five furlongs with him in the Norfolk, though we will give him an entry in the Coventry as well over six."</p><p>Haynes has had five winners in &nbsp;the last week — including debutants Majestic Beauty, Golden Arrow and Hala Emaraaty.</p><p>And earlier this month Haynes enjoyed a&nbsp;trip to Cork and did what few British trainers ever attempt to do — beat the likes of Ger Lyons and Joseph O’Brien in their own backyard to win a Listed race with Joorabchian’s Fix You who could step up to Group company at Haydock next week.</p><p>Haynes said: “Majestic Beauty will go for the Queen Mary after her nice win at Catterick while Golden Arrow will &nbsp;run over five in &nbsp;the Norfolk or Windsor Castle.</p><p>“We&nbsp;have some good older horses going to the Royal meeting too. We’re not just having a pop at the two-year-old races.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“There are lots of ups and downs in this game so you need to be mentally tough, but if you can’t be afraid of taking a chance on these big days.”</p><p>Alice isn’t afraid, but the dinosaurs should be.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.

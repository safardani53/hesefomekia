Furthermore, he provides scholarships from various colleges throughout the state. He was eventually chosen to play football for Brigham Young University.</p><p>He had an outstanding debut season with the BYU Cougars. During his freshman year at BYU, he appeared in all 34 games. Throughout his college years, he received numerous honors and recognitions.

He is also 7 feet 6 inches tall and weighs around 107 kg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Shawn-Bradle-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>To pursue a basketball career, he dropped out of school and entered the 1993 NBA Draft. Furthermore, he was the Philadelphia 76ers’ second overall pick in the first round. Recruiters couldn’t agree on whether he should play in the NBA. Although the athlete’s height gave NBA teams an advantage, his thin body made them doubt his ability. Because he was 7 feet 6 inches tall, the 76ers assigned him jersey number 76.</p><p>Furthermore, the franchise’s management team appointed legendary player Moses Malone as his mentor. Shawn was also named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. Aside from that, he suffered a kneecap injury during his rookie season in the NBA. Despite this, he returned for the following season bigger and better. He set a record for the most blocks in a single season that year.</p><p>Regardless, he had a low point-per-game average and was traded to the New Jersey Nets. During the 1995 season, he was traded to the Nets, where he quickly found his place on the team and began showcasing his abilities. The following season, he had his first triple-double with the Nets. In addition, he was the only NBA player to have two double-blocks in the same game.</p><p>However, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks by the new Nets management. He made some significant improvements in the game while playing for the Dallas Mavericks and was given more playing time. In a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, he scored 32 points. He was also unbeatable on defense and the best shot-blocker in 1997.</p><p>He was also the first NBA player to come off the bench and have at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and ten blocks. However, his progress slowed over the next few seasons. Injuries, being overshadowed by Mavs star players, and other factors were among the reasons he announced his retirement in 2005.</p><p>He joined forces with West Ridge Academy after retiring from the professional basketball league. As a vice-principal, counselor, and coach in a private school, he assisted at-risk youths. Aside from that, he ran for Utah’s 44th Congressional District as a Republican against Democratic Representative Tim Cosgrove. He did not, however, receive enough votes to win the competition.</p><p>He has also appeared in television shows and films. Space Jam, The Singles Ward, Studio C, and Walker, Texas Ranger are just a few of the films in which he has appeared. In addition, he was paralyzed after being hit by a motorist while riding his bicycle near his home in St. George, Utah.</p><h2>Shawn Bradley Net Worth And Awards</h2><p><strong>Shawn Bradley</strong> has received numerous awards and honors throughout his career. He was a second-team Parade All-American and McDonald’s All-American Co-MVP in 1990. In the years that followed, he was second-team All-WAC, NCAA blocks leader, and WAC Freshman of the Year in 1991. In addition, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 1994. He was the NBA’s blocks leader in 1997, a third-team Parade All-American, and Utah’s Mr. Basketball in 1989.</p><p>His net worth is currently estimated to be around $27 million as of September 2023, which he earned from his profession, and he has not yet disclosed his salary and income to the public.</p><h2>Shawn Bradley Wife, Marriage</h2><p>In 1993, <strong>Shawn Bradley married Annette Evertson</strong>. Furthermore, the couple met during their college years but divorced. Due to their significant height disparities, the pair was mocked by fans and media outlets.</p><p>Despite the negativity, hatred, and trolls, they were able to keep their love life pure and unadulterated. Chelsea, Ciera, Charity, and Cheyenne are the couple’s four daughters, and Chase and Chance are their two sons. Following that, he married Carrie Cannon and adopted three of her children in 2019.</p><p>Shawn was fined $10,000 during his playing career for failing to attend a team meeting held in a strip joint.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqoZmno3qjvsCdo56xXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshawn-bradley.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-no-its-becky-shirt-tumblr-meme-post.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-no-its-becky-shirt-tumblr-meme-post.html>Taylor Swifts No Its Becky Shirt Singer Pokes Fun At Meme In Tumblr Post Hollywood</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./samuel-paul-small.html>Samuel Paul Small</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./samuel-paul-small.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

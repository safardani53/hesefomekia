I mean, they work so quickly.</p><p>“There was one point when Kelly’s storyline was so big we were doing ten scenes a day.</p><p>“That’s a lot of dialogue, a lot of turning on the tears in two seconds.”</p><p>While speaking to Lorraine Kelly, Millie said she wanted to follow in idol Jodie's footsteps.</p><p>She said: "I love Jodie Comer. I'm obsessed with Jodie Comer. All of her work is just incredible and her career path is just very idealistic for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000866948443.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/25-12-2023-xmas-preview-865604169.jpg><p>Millie also impressed co-stars including Mikey North — the show’s Gary Windass — who described her as “better than any young actress” he had ever worked with.</p><p>He added: “What- ever she chooses to do in her career will be amazing.”</p><p>It’s not just her acting talent that has helped her to stand out. Millie believes a distinctive mark above her right eyebrow left viewers curious about her too.</p><p>She revealed: “It’s a scar. I fell down the stairs as a baby and the hair’s just never grown back, but everyone thinks I’ve done it myself.</p><p>“In all my baby pictures I look like a right thug.”</p><p>It was reported in April that Millie was <span id=8eaf0061-0294-454b-b4f9-354444ddaf36 class=suggested-link>dating</span> music label owner Tom Neatis after they were spotted holding hands during a romantic stroll on the streets of Salerno, <span id=8d152f05-3c86-4003-8d57-ac40d6ee94f8 class=suggested-link>Italy</span> — but she has since kept her love life under wraps.</p><p>Her talent was recognised at the British Soap Awards in June last year, where she humbly claimed: “I’ve been unbelievably lucky.”</p><p>Two months later it emerged that she would be leaving Weatherfield — which she described as “home” — much to the shock of her parents.</p><p>She explained: “They thought I was crazy. They were like, ‘Why on <span id=622af9ce-3fe2-46ab-a732-bc0060c92574 class=suggested-link>earth</span>?’</p><p>“It’s such a secure position. I was like, ‘Of course, but that’s what the thing is. I don’t need to be secure at the minute’. I need to spread my wings and see what can happen. And nothing could, but I would have regretted it if I hadn’t tried.”</p><p>The teen added that she felt she could take the bold move while she had “no responsibilities” like “having children” or “a mortgage to pay”.</p><p>She said: “I left on a whim. Thank God they didn’t kill off my character, so I could come crawling back.”</p><p>Millie’s “superstitious” aunt believes “fate” may have played a part in landing her new role.</p><p>On her final day of filming for Corrie she received a call from her agent inviting her to audition for Doctor Who’s sidekick.</p><p>The day after her last appearance in the soap aired, she performed a screen test alongside Ncuti.</p><p>And it turned out Doctor Who boss Russell T Davies had monitored Millie’s career since her soap debut.</p><p>He said: “As a Coronation Street fan, I’ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that’s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861756962.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jodie-comer-poses-photographers-premiere-795471548.jpg><p>Millie was sworn to secrecy when she landed the role in October last year and revealed she discovered the <span id=a998c780-1873-4f23-98eb-087203206292 class=suggested-link>news</span> while “waiting to dry off” after getting a spray tan ahead of the National <span id=aa751174-ed9b-44d3-a7cc-05a940187de3 class=suggested-link>Television</span> Awards.</p><p>She recalled: “I got this <span id=2ee6489c-e7fa-41f7-9e60-f50e4c549f87 class=suggested-link>WhatsApp</span> call, asking me to join the call with all my agents.</p><p>“I picked up the phone and they were like, ‘Are you good at keeping secrets?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’</p><p>They said, ‘Are you really good at keeping secrets? ’Cos you’ve got it.’”</p><p>A month later Millie was announced as The Doctor’s new companion during BBC’s <a href=#>Children In Need</a>.</p><p>She revealed former stars including <a href=#>Jodie Whittaker</a>, who played the 13th incarnation of the Time Lord, sent her texts offering their support.</p><p>Karen Gillan, who played Amy Pond, had a bit of advice for her, warning: “It’s only going to get crazier from here.”</p><p>Millie admitted she was “bracing” herself for the show to air and says “it doesn’t seem real” even now.</p><p>She added: “It feels like we’ve made a lovely little project and it’s never going to be released to the world but it is. I’ve got to wrap my head around that.”</p><p>But Millie may need to brace herself for more fanfare than previous companions, because this series is tipped to be the most popular to date.</p><p>That is due to the BBC partnering with Disney+, which will broadcast the show in all regions outside of the UK and Ireland.</p><p>Brand expert Nick believes this collaboration could see Millie’s success eclipse even the most famous previous Doctor Who companions.</p><p>He added: “Now it’s being streamed on Disney+ globally, this will increase the Doctor Who fandom.</p><p>“In turn, it will make Ncuti and Millie globally famous, much like the <span id=9c08fd4d-1133-453b-a304-ea00f20751eb class=suggested-link>power</span> of <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> made Rege Jean Page a globally recognised star and propelled Nicola McLaughlin, from <a href=#>Derry Girls</a> to superstardom.</p><p>“The popularity of Doctor Who means that Millie will be busy promoting the show and filming new seasons so I can expect her to even get her own spin-off on <a href=#>Disney</a> if she becomes a fan favourite.”</p><p>Millie started filming the show in May and has described working with Ncuti as “like a masterclass every day”, adding: “I think he’s made me a better actor.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>We have just a week to wait until the Whovians cast their verdict.</p><p>As for Millie’s future, you might need a Tardis to fit in the opportunities that await.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">SIDEKICKS' BIG-TIME JOURNEYS</h3></p><p>BILLIE PIPER Character: Rose Tyler</p><p>Doctors: Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant.

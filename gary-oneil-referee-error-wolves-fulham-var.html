Clear, he headbutts him on the nose. Isn’t sent off, is given a yellow.</p><p>“Tim Ream should have been sent off for a second bookable offence on the penalty. They’re both my opinions on those, obviously everyone can have their own.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS</a></strong></p><p>“The penalties that went against us, Nelson plays the ball, doesn’t touch Tom Cairney. I watched that back with the referee and, to be fair to him, he says he thinks they’ve got that wrong and he should have been sent to the monitor.</p><p>“Doesn’t help me, doesn’t help all the fans that have travelled all this way to watch the team, doesn’t help the players who are feeling frustrated again.</p><p>“So the Nelson one has pretty much been admitted by the referee that they made a mistake.</p><p>“The one on Harry Wilson we disagree on a little bit. He thinks there’s enough contact there to give a penalty. I think it’s really soft.</p><p>“So you could argue two of them could go against us, but for all four of them to go against us is a tough one for the lads, the supporters and myself to take because we’ve been here a lot of times this season. It’s tough because we didn’t deserve that.”</p><p><a href=#>O’Neil received an apology in August from the PGMOL</a> after not getting a penalty in their 1-0 defeat at Manchester United</p><p>There have also been several other debatable calls that have gone against his team this term.</p><p>Now O’Neil says he has had enough and believes the string of bad decisions are having a huge impact on everyone at the club.</p><p>He said: “Bad luck that it keeps going against us, but there are bad refereeing decisions in there.</p><p>“I’ve had a real grown-up conversation with him in there, I’m trying to remain calm and I’m not angry with anybody, I’m not in there abusing people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-gary-oneil-manager-wolverhampton-862464270.jpg><p>“It’s a conversation around, “come on guys it’s six or seven points now that have gone against us. I’m managing a big football club here.&nbsp;</p><p>“The difference that you’re making to my reputation, the club’s progression up the league, to people’s livelihoods is huge.</p><p>“It can’t be with all the technology, all the time, the biggest league in the world that we’re getting so many wrong. It can’t be okay.</p><p>“What can I do? I have two options really now. I keep behaving the way that I should and I make my players behave in the way that we should, we respect everybody and the decision making. Or we go, that’s not working, we’re going to have to make some noise.</p><p>“I’d rather be a decent human being, answer things honestly and have honest chats with people but things need to get better because I can’t accept us being on the wrong end of decisions as often as we are.”</p><p>O’Neil added that he had been a fan of VAR, however he has now changed his mind and thinks it could be time to step back from using it.</p><p>He said: “I’ve always been for VAR but I think it’s causing a big problem at the moment.</p><p>“The fact that the first one’s not deemed a clear and obvious error but the second one is, I just think VAR has cost us there.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“If it was just a normal referee maybe we concede one penalty from a mistake, the fact that we’ve conceded two…for me, VAR is not helping much with subjective decisions.</p><p>“Maybe tonight has finally turned me against VAR when I thought it would help but it doesn’t seem to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91hJZwa29xX5yus8WMqKWeoZxiv6ayxKucnmWVp7%2BwvoywpqWulah6p8HLoZimZaaWv3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgary-oneil-referee-error-wolves-fulham-var.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tom-brady-reacts-gisele-bundchen-v-magazine-cover.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tom-brady-reacts-gisele-bundchen-v-magazine-cover.html>Tom Brady Reacts To Gisele Bundchens V-Magazine Cover Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vanilla-ice.html>Fame | Vanilla Ice net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vanilla-ice.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Where are the writers getting this from?”</p><p>“Yeah, that's not a thing. Weird clue," wrote another.</p><p>“I've heard the phrase 'That's the toughest ticket in town' in reference to a hot Broadway show, but it might be somewhat old-timey," wrote a third.</p><p>A fourth responded: “I’m an old timer and I can see saying something like, 'that’s a tough ticket to come by.' But I don’t think of tough ticket as a phrase.</p><p>"Tough is just the adjective there. Golden ticket, ticket to ride, ticket out of here are phrases.</p><p>The writers have been terrible lately, and I feel for the contestants this past week in particular."</p><p>A fifth wrote: “I've heard the phrase, but that was an odd choice for a Daily Double" - as the crucial three hidden clues per game entail a contestant picking what to wager and are arguably the most important.</p><p>A sixth even wrote: “I'm gonna really need the writers to speak to one (1) person before coming up with these phrases.</p><p>"I've (barely) heard of a 'hard ticket,' but a tough ticket? Really? At that point, what's stopping me from saying 'tour tensions' or 'Eras ennui' when referencing how hard it is to get Taylor Swift tickets nowadays?"</p><p>Another person commiserated: “Glad to see everyone else thought the 'tough ticket' clue was stupid as s**t.”</p><p>Final Jeopardy! under Bodies of Water read: “The Bass Strait divides Tasmania & mainland Australia & hydrographers have disputed which of these 2 larger bodies it’s part of.”</p><p>Ben and Nabeela were both correct with “Pacific and Indian Oceans” while Lee unfortunately wrote “Pacific and Atlantic” which would be tough to justify geographically.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ben won with a four-day total of $37,293 and will most likely be in the 2023 Tournament of Champions.</p><h2>'WORST CATEGORY EVER?'</h2><p>Ben's seemingly low total (it entails averaging less than $10,000 per win), comes as the contestants have met some inscrutable questions this week.</p><p>On Monday's episode,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a> presented the category "Let's Make a Movie Crossover!"</p><p>One missed clue read: “You stay classy, Kali! A 2004 San Diego news anchorman '&' a 1984 Indiana Jones title structure.”</p><p>Mayim <a href=#>explained</a> it was “Ron Burgundy and The Temple of Doom.”</p><p>One contestant audibly scoffed, and Mayim bluntly said: “OK.”</p><p>Another from the category read:&nbsp;“An Alan Rickman 'Die Hard' villain 'wants those detonators' from a title Great Dane of 2002!”</p><p>Mayim explained the clue they were looking for: “Hans Gruber and Scooby Doo.”</p><p>“No,” Ben simply said, wanting to avoid the category. “That’s bad,” another contestant audibly said out loud.</p><p>One Reddit user wrote: “I usually love wordplay and portmanteau categories, and I also love movie categories. The 'Let's Make a Movie Crossover' category was the worst thing the show has done since letting Dr. Oz guest host."</p><h2>JEOPARDY! SEASON SIMMERS</h2><p>Jeopardy! has just a month before the game show takes the summer off.</p><p><a href=#>Ken Jennings will be returning</a>&nbsp;to host episodes airing from July 3 until July 28 - at which point Jeopardy! takes its annual hiatus.</p><p>He will continue hosting the daily episodes through the Season 39 finale on July 28.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim</a>, 48, splits one of TV's most treasured roles with Ken and has hosted since early May.</p><p>She is stepping back out earlier than expected<a href=#>&nbsp;to support the WGA writers' strike</a>&nbsp;and Ken is returning to wrap up the season instead.</p><p>Ken and the actress were announced last summer as the co-successors to&nbsp;<a href=#>the late, great Alex Trebek</a>, who died from cancer at age 80 in 2020.</p><p>Someone else wondered on Reddit if the WGA strike has something to do with the writing being off-kilter lately.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Do we know when these games were recorded? A number of these bad clues/categories recently seem like they didn't have the final quality/clarity control pass by writers and I'm wondering if it&nbsp;<a href=#>was once they were on strike</a>."</p><p>To which one more claimed: "I think the leftover clues from&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters</a>&nbsp;have been sprinkled into the regular games as of late. That's one reason why we've seen contestants win with low paydays lately."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/taylor-swift-performs-opener-eras-826585508.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-baffled-stupid-daily-double-826665188.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-dub-bizarre-movie-category-826204755-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZGeDcoOVaKGep6CWv6XFjK2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2asn6q0qXnTopqknaRir6a6jKCmpZyjqbKquoytpqehl53BcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-taylor-swift-tough-ticket-ben-goldstein-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./roger-fell-newcastle-monday-horses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./roger-fell-newcastle-monday-horses.html>Trainer Roger Fell delighted to be back racing as he prepares to run seven at Newcastle on Monday's</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jimmy-slayton.html>Fame | Jimmy Slayton net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jimmy-slayton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

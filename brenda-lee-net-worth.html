The song, which was first released in 1958, has become Brenda's most well-known song in the years since it was released, even though she was only 14 years old when it was released.</p><p>Brenda, who is now 78 years old, has had a pretty remarkable life thanks in part to the success of that single song.

In addition to the enormous success of "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree," Brenda also had a umber of other hits during her life, including "Losing You," "Speak to Me Pretty," and "Sweet Nothin's."</p><p>Ultimately, though, Brenda's net worth is chiefly thanks to the continued success of her signature holiday song, which is still licensed and played regularly during the holiday season.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Brenda Lee</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $20 Million</p><p style=text-align:start>Brenda Lee is an American singer best known for her song "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree," which was recorded and released when she was just 14 years old. Brenda recorded a number of other popular songs over the course of her career, and became the oldest person with a number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2023.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthdate</strong>: Jan. 7, 1971</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthplace</strong>: Atlanta, Ga.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth Name</strong>: Brenda Mae Tarpley</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Father</strong>: Ruben Lindsey Tarpley</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Mother</strong>: Annie Grayce</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Children</strong>: Jolie and Julie</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brenda Lee released her last album in 2007.</h2><p>Although Brenda had her greatest level of success as a child performer in the 1950s and '60s, she continued to record and release music for decades afterward, and her last album, "Gospel Duets With Treasured Friends," was released in 2007. She was already coming to national attention as early as 1955, when she was just 11 years old, but the peak of her career came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as she was becoming a young adult.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In 2023, decades after her successful career, Brenda has finally recorded her first number one hit, and it naturally came with the song that she has come to be most closely associated with in the decades since it was initially released. As many failed Christmas albums will tell you, it's hard for songs to become a new Christmas staple.</p><p>"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" has had that status for decades, and it's clearly responsible for a good deal of Brenda's continued financial success. Thanks to that song along, Brenda will likely never be poor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BmusOaZKWdlWK7psCMsKarrJg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrenda-lee-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elvira-oberg.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elvira-oberg.html>Fame | Elvira berg net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ashamed-jockey-gina-mangan-whip-ban.html>'Ashamed' jockey warned 'this is your last chance' by bosses as she gets another big ban</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ashamed-jockey-gina-mangan-whip-ban.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

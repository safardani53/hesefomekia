She had been diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumor, and doctors told her she had six months to live. She decided to end her life on her own terms and utilized a prescribed fatal dose of barbiturates instead of allowing the cancer to progress and inflict more pain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diaz, 49, lives in the same Alamo, California house that he and Maynard bought together in 2012. The holidays are always "tough," he tells PEOPLE, because "Brittany's absence is the most obvious and felt by everyone in attendance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brittany would decorate the house for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the holiday season always started early for the couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Brittany had this flare," he shares. "She'd put up all these candles, ornaments and holly to make the house feel warm and inviting."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy TheBrittanyFund.org and Dan Diaz</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Her job for me was decorating the exterior, hanging up the lights, the wreaths and all of that to make the outside look bright and cheerful,"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It took a few years after his wife's death for Diaz to dust off their crates of Christmas decorations and keep his promise to Maynard that he'd make the house festive for the holidays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Now, I do my portion of stringing the lights on the exterior of the house, like Brittany expected of me every year, to keep the house looking nice and cheerful," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside their home, the couple enjoyed visiting California's wine country before New Year's Eve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We'd just get away from the craziness of the holidays: the gifts, the shopping, the malls and just spend time as the two of us," he says. "It was one of those moments where you get to just appreciate the person you're with and do things that we'd enjoy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This year, Diaz says he'll be spending the holidays with his family in California. If Maynard were still alive, Diaz imagines he'd be with her and the children they wanted to have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had aspirations to have our own family and were in the process of starting when we discovered her brain tumor," he says. "So when I personally reflect on the holiday season, I imagine maybe we'd have a little 5-year-old and 3-year-old running around the house."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continues: "Cancer took that opportunity from us, and that's what I reflect on during the holidays, but at the same time, I also reflect on the seven and a half years Brittany and I had together."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy thebrittanyfund.org</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diaz <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>has become a fierce advocate</a> for end-of-life options following Maynard's death, working alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Compassion & Choices</a>, an end-of-life advocacy organization. An advocate and activist for the controversial <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>right-to-die movement</a>, Brittany worked tirelessly with the organization to expand death-with-dignity laws around the country.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014 the family temporarily moved from California to Oregon so Maynard could have access to the state's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Death with Dignity Act</a>, which allows physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to certain terminally ill patients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My glioblastoma is going to kill me and that's out of my control," she told PEOPLE after her diagnosis. "I've discussed with many experts how I would die from it and it's a terrible, terrible way to die. So being able to choose to go with dignity is less terrifying."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Maynard died, dignity statues only existed in Washington, Oregon, Vermont and Montana. Currently, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>eight states</a> in the United States, plus Washington D.C., allow the terminally ill to die with medical assistance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diaz says terminally ill patients and their family members will frequently approach him to say how grateful they are for Brittany's advocacy and starting a public conversation about the right-to-die movement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Their gratitude is so meaningful to me because it highlights the impact that Brittany made," Diaz says. "So during this time of year, as we reflect on all the blessings that we have in our lives, it's those moments that I think about. That keeps me going and it's how I honor Brittany's legacy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8GroK2skaPGbrnAsqWaqpRitba%2FwZqlnWWUlrtusMiasWahnZa0qrrErGShp5yesaLF0mauoqyYYsGpscirZJ%2BZnZ65uns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrittany-maynard-husband-dan-diaz-imagines-holidays-with-their-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dwts-bruno-tonioli-meghan-markle-would-be-great-on-the-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dwts-bruno-tonioli-meghan-markle-would-be-great-on-the-show.html>DWTS' Bruno Tonioli: Meghan Markle Would Be 'Great' on the Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./briana-dejesus-i-want-to-start-posting-my-nudes-on-onlyfans.html>Briana DeJesus: I'm Thinkin' About Dabbling in This Whole Adult Content Thing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./briana-dejesus-i-want-to-start-posting-my-nudes-on-onlyfans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

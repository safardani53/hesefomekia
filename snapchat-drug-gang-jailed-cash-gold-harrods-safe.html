Shout me."</p><p>Sadiq was helped by Jordan Devine, who was his right hand man in the Rodger Dodger operation.</p><p>This side of the drugs business worked in the same way as Dr Greengo.</p><p>The hearing was told police soon made their move on Sadiq and his clan.</p><p>Sadiq was arrested at Harrods - he was also found to have safety boxes in Edinburgh and Glasgow's Pollokshields.</p><p>Mr Harvey: "The total cash seized at the boxes was £913,310.</p><p>"The total value of gold, jewellery and watches was £269,045."</p><p>The court heard it was found that in one day in June 2021, Sadiq had paid £8,150 for Louis Vuitton items in Harrods as well as £1,300 at clubs and hotels in London.</p><p>Devine meantime also splashed the cash including £3,200 at Manchester's designer Selfridges store and a £522 bill at London's swanky Nobu restaurant.</p><p>It further emerged that in a seven-month period in 2021, a total of £174,702 was paid into one bank account.</p><p>Another had £159,905 going in with a third £136,100.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/jamshhaid-yaqoob-one-s-seven-836971631.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/2023-following-operation-ran-detectives-850511229.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/2023-following-operation-ran-detectives-850511227.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/2023-following-operation-ran-detectives-850511226.jpg><p>At the earlier hearing, Mr Harvey explained the roles of Sadiq's other associates.</p><p>Robertson was paid for his help in the Dr Greengo operation.</p><p>Davies also benefitted by organising bank accounts to be used.</p><p>Yaqoob dropped off cannabis and collected cash while Ahmed stored drugs and helped arrange sales.</p><p>Raja was also part of the Dr Greengo set up.</p><p>Sadiq's lawyer John Scullion KC today said the drugs set-up appeared "innovative", but there was also a "a degree of naivety" about it.</p><p>Brian McConnachie KC, defending Robertson - who broke his neck after falling from a balcony in Barcelona this year - got involved for "financial gain".</p><p>Solicitor advocate Ross Yuill said Davies had only first actually met members of the gang in person when they appeared in court in August.</p><p>Alan MacLeod, defending Yaqoob, told the court he became involved after the pandemic affected his job as a taxi driver.</p><p>Thomas Ross KC meantime said Ahmed "had brought no honour to his respectable family" by both taking and dealing in drugs.</p><p>Lawyer Billy Lavelle told the judge Devine realised he had "ruined his life" by turning to crime.</p><p>Tony Graham KC had asked for Raja not to be locked up due to a number of factors including the time scale of his involvement being less.</p><p>Sentencing, Lord Clark told the gang: "Serious organised crime damages the very fabric of our society.</p><p>"The supply of controlled drugs blights our communities and the wellbeing of individuals."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Addressing drug boss Sadiq, the judge said: "You headed the Dr Greengo and Rodger Dodger operations.

Be warned, your scalp will show in places.</li><li><strong>Number 2:&nbsp;</strong>A short hairstyle which doesn't expose your scalp, leaves 1/4 of an inch of hair. <a href=# rel=noopener>Men's Hairstyles Now</a> recommend a no2 for balding or thinning blokes.</li><li><strong>Number 3:&nbsp;</strong>A common choice for men who want a low-maintenance cut, leaves 3/8 of an inch.</li><li><strong>Number 4:&nbsp;</strong>The middle length available, we're now moving into brush or crew cut territory.</li><li><strong>Number 5:&nbsp;</strong>Leaves 5/8 of an inch of hair, which is enough to be styled and brushed.</li><li><strong>Number 6:&nbsp;</strong>Long enough to do tapered (i.e. shorter) sides, leaves 6/8 of an inch on top.</li><li><strong>Number 7:&nbsp;</strong>Looking for a trim that just buzzes on the top without the need for scissors? The no7's your man.</li><li><strong>Number 8:&nbsp;</strong>The longest clipper size available, leaving a full inch of hair. Use it to trim the top, and style the sides with the lower guard numbers.</li></ul><p>When it comes to clippers, it's best to chop longer hair with scissors first.</p><h2>When did Prince William change his hair and what did it look like before?</h2><p>At the age of seven, the young Prince sported a pudding bowl look before moving on to the more elegant side parting and swept fringe.</p><p><a href=#>For most of his childhood, his hair was thick</a> and generally swept straight.</p><p>But in the early noughties, it looked slightly curlier and more untamed.</p><p>For his first ever press conferences at the start of the new century, he donned a lighter blond hairdo before he ventured off on his gap year.</p><p><a href=#>While at university</a> from 2001 until graduating in 2005, the Prince had a full head of hair.</p><p>He wore his blond locks short at the sides with a tousled look on top.</p><p><a href=#>Prince William</a> joined the armed services in 2006, wearing his hair short on top and at the sides, but there were already signs of hair loss.</p><p>One of the most notable signs was spotted during a football match at the 2006 <a href=#>World Cup</a>, where he was photographed from above, showing his thinning hair.</p><p>Since then, his <a href=#>hairline has continued to recede</a> on the top of his head.</p><p>At his <a href=#>wedding</a> to <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> on April 29, 2011, his <a href=#>hair was styled</a> as a short back and sides, but showed sides of receding at the front.</p><p>In 2016, Wills opted for a more trim look, at the sides and short on <a href=#>top as his hair thinned</a>.</p><p>Then in<a href=#> 2018 he sported his No1 cut</a>, before opting for a less severe shave since then.</p><p>The Prince has previously poked fun at his receding hairline, telling hairstylist Taz Kabria: "I don't have much hair, I can't give you much business," during a visit to a hairdresser's salon.</p><p>His brother <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> would also tease him about losing his hair.</p><p>While chatting to a <a href=#>Second World War</a> veteran in Barbados in 2010, Harry remarked that William "was already bald aged 12".</p><p>But it's not all bad news for the Prince, as in 2021 he was <a href=#>named the world's sexiest bald man</a>.</p><h2>Who cuts the Royal Family's hair?</h2><p>Award-winning <a href=#>celebrity hair stylist Joey Wheeler</a> cuts the <a href=#>Royal Family's</a> hair.</p><p>He is the senior stylist at Richard Ward, where he has been working for over a decade.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More in The Sun</h2></p><p>His long list of famous clients has included <a href=#>Declan Donnelly</a>, <a href=#>Lewis Hamilton,</a> and <a href=#>Michael Caine</a> – to name but a few.</p><p>Along with styling the hair of well-known faces, he has also worked for the likes of Vogue magazine on fashion shoots.</p><p class=postsid

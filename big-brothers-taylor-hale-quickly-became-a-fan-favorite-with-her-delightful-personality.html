Viewers were introduced to the 16 houseguests, who will now fight in a series of tasks to earn the title and a huge $750,000 cash prize.&nbsp;Taylor Hale emerged as the popular favorite among the 16 houseguests revealed in the premiere, because of her pleasant demeanor and flair. The Big Brother series has been a huge hit with fans, with multiple successful seasons and spin-offs. Season 24 players will use their best game strategy and establish strong alliances to help them advance in the tournament.</p><h2>Fans react to Taylor Hale’s Big Brother debut.</h2><p>Taylor Mackenzie Dickens Hale, a 27-year-old personal stylist from West Bloomfield, Michigan, has emerged as the fan-favorite participant after Big Brother Season 24’s opening episode. In addition, she was named Miss Michigan USA in 2021.&nbsp;According to Angelopedia, the celebrity graduated from George Washington University and is proficient in French and English. She has made a name for herself on the pageant circuit, competing in Miss District of Columbia USA in 2017 and was named Miss Pure Michigan in 2019.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Taylor-Hale-1.jpeg alt="Taylor Hale" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Taylor acknowledged in an interview with Parade that she was much more than a pageant queen. The celebrity stated:</p><p>“There’s a lot more under my feet. I’m a lot more clever than people think. So I’ll make them believe I’m foolish before slitting their necks on the rear end. People will probably regard me as someone who is merely here for the show. You have the hair, the makeup, and some really tight outfits, I won’t lie. But I’m here to play a tough game.”</p><p>Taylor said that she prefers to play to her strengths rather than a plan when it comes to forging alliances. She, on the other hand, sought to demonstrate that women are much more than their outward beauty.&nbsp;Fans were blown away by the Big Brother contestant’s manner and flocked to social media to congratulate her:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Taylor is already giving me “season fav” vibes <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#bb24</a></p><p>— brandon (@brandongutley) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I already know Brittany and Taylor are going to be the screenshot queens this szn for different reasons <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#BB24</a></p><p>— atavan halen. (@AmeliaXCV) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2022</a></p><h2>To begin the premiere, a distinctive concept and an intriguing residence were chosen.</h2><p>The 16 houseguests were presented to the viewers in Big Brother Season 24’s opening episode. Fans have been anticipating this season’s participants with bated breath, looking forward to performances, new friendships, and a whole lot of turmoil. Longtime presenter Julie Chen Moonves welcomed the participants to the villa for the start of a new season and a new summer.&nbsp;The subject of this year’s Big Brother season, BB Fest, corresponds to the summer season. In an exclusive interview with US Weekly earlier this month, Julie provided some specifics about the theme:</p><p>“Throughout the summer, you’ll witness various themes, such as a music festival, a comedy festival, and a Renaissance festival.” But my personal favorite – and I believe most others would agree – will be the Zing Fest.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Taylor-Hale-1-1.jpg alt="Taylor Hale" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It will be fascinating to observe how the houseguests respond to various challenges during the various fests. They’ve also moved into their new home, which has a “mid-century Palm Springs feel” to it, complete with neon lighting and vacation vibes. The home is known as the BB Motel.&nbsp;The participants will face eviction in the week’s final show, which will be televised live. However, the presenter claims that this season’s elimination would be different from past seasons:</p><p>“I believe the major news is that the first live eviction night will be unlike any other eviction night we’ve ever had because it may not be one of the individuals you assume would be evicted that night.” These houseguests won’t find out about this unexpected twist until that night.”</p><p>The Big Brother houseguests will face several twists and turns as they seek to become champion and win home the $100,000 prize. Readers may continue to watch Big Brother on CBS. Every week, three episodes will be shown. The new episodes will run on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET and 9.00 p.m. ET.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZop9dl7%2BwwMeeqaxlpJbGrbvRZp%2BapJVivra1wqSjsmWSmrCiucRmmGaekaN6p63VqKmirJVixKrAx2afnqpdmbKttcahq5%2BtnGK9pr7SqKWapJmpxnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-brothers-taylor-hale-quickly-became-a-fan-favorite-with-her-delightful-personality.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./calebfromig.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./calebfromig.html>Calebfromig- Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-cosmos-wife-list.html>Who is James Cosmo Dating James Cosmo's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-cosmos-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

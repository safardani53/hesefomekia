According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, Pedro said about his co-star, "I had an amazing time with Robin Tunney, she is a new friend, and it was a really friendly set.”</p><p>As for more details about their relationship, well, we may never know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lena Headey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another under-the-radar romance took place in 2014, reportedly, when Pedro and his Game of Thrones co-star <a href=#>Lena Headey</a>, who of course played <a href=#>Cersei Lannister</a>, became an item.</p><p>The two remained mum about the nature of their relationship, but fans' tongues began wagging when the British actor shared a very cozy selfie featuring Pedro, along with the caption, "Sunshine love."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"<a href=#>Jaime</a> will not be happy about this," joked one Instagram user, referring to the fictional incestuous relationship between Cersei and her brother on the HBO drama.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Back in the 1990s, Pedro was equally demure about dating another co-star from a short stint on <a href=#>Law & Order</a>. Some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> say he was with this <a href=#>Orange Is the New Black</a> alum for a night, while others suggest the two were together for a decade.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Maria Dizzia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Perhaps one of the earliest relationships that Pedro was determined to keep under wraps was with Maria Dizzia. The stars were linked back in the '90s, when the actor was doing bit parts on <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> and Touched by an Angel.</p><p>Although the length of Pedro and Maria's time as a couple is not known, hey, guess what — not much else is known about how serious they were or if they were actually ever a real couple.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pedro Pascal may currently be single.</h2><p>Pedro keeps his romantic life private even to this day, as his star is on the rise.</p><p>He'll share photos on social media with his <a href=#>family members</a>, but not with dates. The <a href=#>HBO</a> staple even took his sister, Javiera, to the Oscars in March 2023.

He has hinted at being averse to having his heart broken. "I don’t like psychological, emotional, or physical pain," Pedro told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> in January 2023.</p><p>Pedro also called himself "a people pleaser," and opened up about <a href=#>his character on The Last of Us</a>, perhaps offering some insight into how he sees relationships.</p><p>"I think what’s scary about Joel is that none of us really know what we’d be capable of if faced with the idea of losing love," the actor told the outlet.</p><p>Pedro also said, "Whether it’s conscious or unconscious, being alive or even being a human being is directly connected to the love you feel. Existing is connected to the love you feel toward a particular relationship — your child, your partner — and to lose that? Some people are not capable of applying rational thought to that kind of loss, or the threat of that loss, or the threat of that loss again, right?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKlvs5mp5qrk5a5brDAraCnn12dtrTAzquw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpedro-pascal-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sistine-stallone-green-bikini-mexico-mom-jennifer-flavin-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sistine-stallone-green-bikini-mexico-mom-jennifer-flavin-photos.html>Sistine Stallones Green Bikini In Mexico With Jennifer Flavin: Pics Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./doutzen-kroes.html>Doutzen Kroes Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./doutzen-kroes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

However, she recommends paying close attention to the features of such bras, as you should opt for styles with full coverage, adjustable straps, and a supportive band. “Look for bras that offer full coverage to prevent spillage and have a wide and sturdy band under the bust for support,” she says. “Also, make sure your bra has adjustable straps that allow you to customize the fit for your comfort and needs.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How to fit bras for plus size chests?</span></p><p>According to Mangiarotti, finding a well-fitting bra is a personal process that requires considering your comfort and needs as you shop. However, if you’re still unsure which bra is best for your bust, it’s always a good idea to visit a nearby lingerie store or boutique for a professional fitting. “Experienced fitters can help you find the right size and style that suits your body shape and provides the best support,” she adds.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97428139183056><p><span class=accordion__title>What is considered plus size bras?</span></p><p>“Plus-size bras are designed for individuals with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>larger bust sizes</a>, typically beyond what is considered the standard or average range,” Mangiarotti tells PEOPLE. “While the specific size range can vary among different brands and regions, plus-size bras generally start at around a US size 38C (or 40C) and go up from there.” Plus-size bras also have features that traditional bras lack, such as wider bands, stronger underwires, reinforced side panels, and wider straps, all of which offer better support. “These bras also have extra padding and support in the cups to provide shaping and lift,” adds Mangiarotti.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Courtney Leiva</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE.

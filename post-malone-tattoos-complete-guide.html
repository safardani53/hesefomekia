In 2020, he told GQ <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>why he covered his face in designs</a>, saying, "I'm a ugly-ass motherf-----. It does maybe come from a place of insecurity, to where I don't like how I look, so I'm going to put something cool on there so I can look at myself and say, 'You look cool, kid,' and have a modicum of self-confidence, when it comes to my appearance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Sunflower" singer's many tattoos range from tributes to his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>young daughter</a> and portraits of music legends to recurring motifs of snakes, skulls and guns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2023, Malone was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>denied entry to an Australian bar because of his tattoos</a>, which was something he "never really experienced" before. "They turned me away for my tattoos," he told The West Australian of QT Perth's rooftop bar.

However, not every facial tattoo is always visible as some are covered by his beard or head of hair. Here are <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Post Malone</a>'s most notable face tattoos.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Daughter's Initials</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chad Rowe/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Malone <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>paid tribute to his baby daughter</a> by inking her initials, DDP, on the right side of his forehead in a huge gothic script. The sweet, sentimental tattoo is a way for the touring musician to keep his baby near him even when he's on the road.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's really tough not being able to see her, but she's coming out more often now," Malone told GQ in 2022.

He documented the process on Instagram Stories, and photographer Adam DeGross also shared the ink session on Instagram.

"I have cut my hair even shorter, also skeletons are cool. Spread your heart as much as you can," he wrote in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram post</a> showing off the new ink. "A little love goes farther than you think.

What I might lack in handsomeness, I make up for in intrigue, at least," he's said. As for the placement, it was painful.

He was born on October 20, 1988. To give him a better future, they migrated to Greece, leaving him in Nigeria with his grandparents for a few years.</p><p>He played basketball at a semi-professional level and also played professional soccer.</p><p>Though he is not as famous as his brothers, he has explored himself more than anybody else. He has indulged himself in musical pursuits as well.</p><p>On July 22, 2020, Francis released his first single, ‘Shekoshi.’</p><p>On February 9, 2023, he updated his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> post to release another version of Rise, an afro banger, in which Nikolas Kontoudakis have done videography.</p><h3>Thanasis Antetokounmpo</h3><p>Nicknamed ‘The Greek Streak,’&nbsp;Thanasis&nbsp;is a professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA.</p><p>He started his professional career with Filathlitikos, averaging 12.2 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game.</p><p>Thanasis was selected 51st overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks. However, he made his NBA debut two years later, in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Three-Antetokounmpo-sons-with-mom-1024x1024.jpg><p>In 2019, he signed with Milwaukee Bucks, reunited with his brother Giannis, and jointly won the 2021 NBA Finals with the Bucks.</p><p>On February 1, 2023, Thanasis posted a reel about his new podcast named ‘Thanalysis,’ in which Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the popular social media Reddit and the beloved husband of <a href=#>Serena Williams</a>, cheekily commented, “Yooo when am I coming on???” to which Thanasis replied “soon.”</p><p>Fans are already excited about his new venture.</p><h3>Giannis Antetokounmpo</h3><p>Giannis is the most accomplished brother out of five, having won back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player awards in 2019 and 2020. Aside from <a href=#>LeBron James</a> and <a href=#>Kareem Abdul Jabbar</a>, he is the only player to win it before turning 26.&nbsp;</p><p>The MVP was drafted 15th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by Milwaukee Bucks. He is a member of the Bucks alongside his brother <a href=#>Thanasis</a> and has been named to All-Star Game seven times.</p><p>Because of his stature, quickness, ball-handling abilities, and height of 2.13 meters, Giannis was nicknamed Greek Freak.</p><p>Milwaukee Bucks offered him the largest contract in NBA history during the contract extension of 2020.</p><p>He signed a contract worth $228.2 for a 5-year, with a 2025 player option included.</p><p>Giannis led the Bucks to their first championship in 50 years in the 2021 NBA final.</p><p>The Bucks’ star averaged 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.8 blocks throughout the series and was unanimously crowned NBA Finals MVP. He is the youngest Finals MVP since <a href=# rel=noopener>Kawhi Leonard</a> in 2014.</p><p>He was honored as the league’s greatest player of all time after being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in the same year.</p><p>Based on the life of Antetokounmpo and his family, the biopic Rise was released in 2022.</p><p>He was named the Eastern Conference captain for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game on January 23, 2023.</p><p>He surpassed Paul Pressey for the most assists in Bucks franchise history on February 16.</p><p>While playing against Miami Heat on 25 February 2023, he knocked his knee with an opponent, which led him to come out of the game in the first quarter.</p><p>Consequently, he missed Buck’s 104-101 victory over the Suns with what the team is describing as a bruised right quadriceps.</p><p>He had sprained his wrist on February 16 as the Bucks won against Chicago, their last game before the All-Star break.</p><h3>Kostas Antetokounmpo</h3><p>When Giannis started playing for the Bucks, his family moved to the United States in 2013, and Kostas attended Dominican High School for his junior and senior years.</p><p>In his senior year, Kostas was a member of their basketball team and helped them win the state championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gianna-Kostas-Thanasis-at-the-game-1024x1024.jpg><p>Philadelphia 76ers drafted Kostas as the final pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. However, he was later traded to the Dallas Mavericks.&nbsp;</p><p>Later the Los Angeles Lakers claimed Antetokounmpo off waivers on July 22, 2019. In 2020, he played five games throughout the season but was not selected for the final match.</p><p>However, the Lakers won the championship that season, defeating Miami Heat, making Kostas the first Greek player to win the NBA championship.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, he played for teams like ASVEL, Windy City Bulls, and Fenerbahce. Kostas is playing for the Fenerbahce Beko of the Turkish Basketball Super League.</p><h3>Alex Antetokounmpo</h3><p>Alex is the youngest child, thirteen years younger than Francis. After his family moved to the United States in 2013, Alex attended St. Monica School in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex finished high school at Dominican High School like his older brother Kostas. Kostas was a two-time All-State basketball player for his high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Charles-and-his-youngest-son-Alex-1024x1024.jpg><p>Due to his basketball skills, he got scholarships from DePaul, Ohio, and Green Bay. However, he dropped out of college to begin his professional career in the Liga ACB of Spain.</p><p>Furthermore, he joined the Sacramento Kings for the 2021 NBA Summer League after going undrafted in the 2021 NBA Draft. The Kings went on to win the NBA Summer League in 2021.</p><p>He was named to the opening night roster for the Wisconsin Herd in the NBA G League on November 3, 2022.</p><h2>Family Value Through The Eye Of Giannis</h2><p>Human embodiments of dedication, hope, and hard work, Giannis’ work ethic, mental makeup, and the story have built the ‘Giannis effect’ around America.</p><h3>Finding Giannis</h3><p>A skinny guy playing in Greece was far from the build a basketball player needs to have. However, he showed and made himself known to the agents from where his career took a turn with his skill.</p><p>The first goal in generating the chance was to build his body by increasing his diet, but it was difficult to ask in a massive household with many mouths to feed and a limited income.</p><p>On the other hand, his family did everything they could to provide him with whatever he needed and to remove the obstacles, for which he expresses his eternal gratitude.</p><p>With solely his play in Greece and little help from agents, he soon gained the attention of the NBA team.&nbsp;</p><h3>Into the Unknown</h3><p>In 2013, he was drafted by Milwaukee Bucks; however, he wasn’t an enthusiast of the news. His family couldn’t come, and he could care less about NBA and prioritized his family over it.</p><p>Whoever he was, it was all because of his family, and he couldn’t simply abandon them and settle down in America.</p><p>However, his father persuaded and encouraged him, stating that this opportunity might benefit their family, and thankfully he accepted his father’s advice and returned to the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Charles-Fatherly-Moment-1024x1024.jpg><p>He once said, “My family sacrificed a lot of things that gave me the opportunity to be here, and I can’t thank them enough every day.”</p><p>In the absence of his family and living in an unknown country, he was vulnerable and scared and would sleep in the gym because he had no reason to go home. Giannis didn’t want to go home because he was alone.</p><p>It was stressful because he was unsure if his family could accompany him.</p><p>In addition, his family visa was declined twice out of three opportunities. He stated if this happened the third time and his family couldn’t come, he would quit America.</p><h3>Soaring To The Top</h3><p>More than being drafted into the NBA, his family’s arrival on Visa was a pivotal moment for him.</p><p>His jersey number, 34, is based on his parent’s birth year, as his father was born in 1963 and his mother in 1964.</p><p>His unparalleled work ethic, character, and family values are the main reasons for his success, and his parents are primarily responsible for instilling these qualities in him.</p><h2>Charles Antetokounmpo Death</h2><p>Unfortunately, the person who guided Giannis to be a man of character died at 54 on September 20, 2017. Sadly, he didn’t see his son become the Most Valuable Player in the NBA.</p><p>Charles unexpectedly died of a heart attack at his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This news brought a great shock to the Antetokounmpo family.</p><p>They believe that winning and losing don’t matter, but what matters the most is living up to their father’s legacy. So the brothers’ primary goal is to fulfill their father’s legacy.</p><h2>Popularity Graph</h2><p>Charles Antetokounmpo was the father of five of his sons, known as the Antetokounmpo Brothers.

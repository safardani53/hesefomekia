Loafers combine dressy and sophisticated with casual and cool, making them one of the most — if not, the most — versatile shoe styles in any given wardrobe.

These flats are inspired by loafers but have a pointed toe and low heel (that’s functionally inexistent).

The Balin loafers feature a chunky lug sole and about a 1.5-inch heel that adds plenty of height and traction.

Dr. Kuizinas says it’s important to consider the type of sole that best fits your needs. If foot pain or support is a concern, she recommends a flat sole (versus a high heeled style) so that your body will be in a more natural alignment when you walk. “An elevated heel can push your body weight forward, causing you more strain to the forefoot and toes,” she explains. “It can also cause your toes to grip more in your shoes and, over time, can lead to ankle stiffness.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Kuizinas says to also look for a flexible sole, which will allow your foot to move and bend naturally as you walk. “Without this, the muscles and joints in your feet can easily become stiff.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort and Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fit is a key component to comfort. “Make sure the fit is snug with no gaps or tightness,” says Smith, who notes that loafers should fit like a glove and be thought of as an extension of your feet. Additionally comfort perks like padded insoles, EVA outsoles, and good traction can also make a difference in comfort and leave you feeling more stable on your feet.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Choosing a color and material that meshes with your current wardrobe is super important when hunting for loafers,” says Danielle Cafiero, a fashion stylist and wardrobe consultant. She recommends looking at black and neutral leathers if you want to maximize wear or are looking to invest in a higher priced pair. However, fun colors, patent, and embellished loafers can also elevate day-to-night dressing so, if you love the loafer style, it’s worth splurging on a fun pair, too.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-3a60c98b-7320-4074-8a08-8ce2f6ac88af></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=51><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you wear socks with loafers?</span></p><p>When styling a pair of loafers with socks, Smith says it really depends on the occasion and your personal preference. “Generally, socks are not a requirement when wearing loafers, but it can be a great way to add another layer of sophistication,” he notes. Cafiero adds that socks are a fun way to dress up your loafer and make them more aligned with your personal style.</p><p>“Pair a chunkier knit sock with a classic horsebit style or team a thin calf-length version with both minimal and chunkier loafer options,” she adds, noting that adding a pair of calf socks over sheer tights can elevate the preppy skirt and loafer look.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you wear loafers with jeans?</span></p><p>Some might prefer loafers with a cropped or fitted pair of jeans, however, Cafiero says you can wear them with virtually any style, including flair. When pairing loafers with jeans, she says the most important thing isn’t the style, it’s the length of the denim. “For example, with baggier and relaxed styles, you can roll them up to expose more skin and create balance with a slim loafer,” she explains.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does it take to break in loafers?</span></p><p>According to Cafiero, it usually takes around 3 to four wears to break in a new pair of loafers. “I recommend increasing the amount of wear slowly over the course of those initial wears to stretch them out properly,” she explains.</p><p>One trick for breaking in loafers is to wear them at the end of the day when your feet are more swollen, which can stretch the shoes out to a more comfortable fit. “You can also use a blow dryer for 30 seconds to help stretch any tight-fitting areas of the loafer,” Cafiero adds.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are expensive loafers worth it?</span></p><p>Expensive loafers are certainly worth it if they are a shoe you’ll get lots of wear out of. “If you’re considering investing in an expensive pair of loafers, gauge how frequently you’ll wear the loafer,” says West. She adds that, while they do come with a high price tag, expensive loafers from luxury brands are typically made from premium materials, have upgraded hardware, and even boast comfort features like padded insoles for support, which can all be worth it in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, you don’t need to invest a ton of money in a new pair of loafers, especially if you’re just wanting to test the trend out. Since loafers are super trendy right now, West says you can find lots of high quality styles at a range of price points and, if you’re new to the style, it might be worth it to go for a less expensive option before making the investment.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.

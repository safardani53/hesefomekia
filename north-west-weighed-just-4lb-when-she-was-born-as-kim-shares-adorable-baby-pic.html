Although she is now just 10 years old, Kardashian fans were convinced she is in her teenage years as she begins to “look more like Kim.”</p><p>However, the picture Kim shared of North as a baby sees her as a tiny little human with her eyes just slightly open. When North was two months, Kanye West appeared on Kris Jenner’s talk show and shared the first photo of North.</p><p>Kris asked who Kanye thought baby North looked like. “I pray she looks like her mother when she’s older,” he replied, as per Made for Mums. <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> said: “I think she’s an amazing combination of the two of you.”</p><p>She added: “She’s so adorable, she has Kim’s eyes, I think, and she has your cheeks and both of your lips.” Members of the Kardashian family have been sharing adorable pictures of North as a younger kid on her birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/GettyImages-453551164-717x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-was-north-west-born>When was North West born?</h2><p>North West was born on June 15, 2013.

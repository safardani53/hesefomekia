He was the first overall pick in the 2017 draft after a college career playing for Texas A&M, and after more than a half-decade of success in the <a href=#>NFL</a>, many are now wondering whether the NFL star is married.</p><p>Myles has recorded 14 sacks this season, and he's part of a Cleveland Browns defense that has proven to be among the best in the league during the regular season. Although it can be hard for defensive players to break out, Myles has managed to do that during the course of his career.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Myles Garrett married?</h2><p>Myles Garrett isn't married, but he and his girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Serra Tumay</a> have been together for several years. Serra works with Aston Villa, one of the soccer clubs in the English Premier League, as a nutritionist. That expertise likely helps at home as well, as it means that Myles's partner is someone who knows the ins and outs of how professional athletes should eat.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Serra was born in California in July 1991. Serra's parents are from Turkey, and they lived there for some of Serra's childhood before moving to the U.S. Serra was a state-champion soccer player in high school and went on to play soccer at NYU while she studied nutrition. She has worked with UCLA as a nutritionist and has also given lectures on the topic in many places across the country.</p><p>Myles and Serra have been dating since at least July 2019, which is when he made his first appearance on her Instagram page. Although the couple has been relatively low profile, and has had to make their relationship work long distance for much of the year, they made headlines in September 2022 when they were in a car accident. The accident happened after they swerved to avoid hitting a wild animal, and Myles was more seriously injured, although both of them were ultimately fine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Myles Garrett has a supportive and athletic family.</h2><p>Myles's parents are Audrey and Lawrence Garrett, and he grew up in Texas. Audrey was a college athlete in track and field, and she has been an outspoken advocate for her son's career.</p><p>Myles also has two siblings, and his older brother, Sean Williams, played in the NBA from 2007 to 2012. Despite that success, though, Myles has often cited Sean as a cautionary tale due to his reliance on marijuana, which ultimately limited him.</p><p>Sean is Myles's half-brother, but he also has a sister named Brea who competed in track and field at Texas A&M. Brea is Myles's older sister, and she was instrumental in his decision to play football for the school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfosatsdJmnpqqoprBtXnMmqmroZWZ</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmyles-garrett-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jonathan-majors-19890907-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jonathan-majors-19890907-html.html>Jonathan Majors (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./giannis-antetokounmpo-father.html>Giannis Antetokounmpo Father Charles [2023 Update]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./giannis-antetokounmpo-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

In 2020, he parlayed into television as ⅓ of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Soul’s Tea-Gif</a> panel. The series, starring Funky, <a href=#>Claudia Jordan</a>, and <a href=#>Al Reynolds</a>, quickly grew praise for its unique approach to commentary centering on the Black LGBTQIA community.</p><p>To fans’ surprise, Funky Dineva announced that his time on Tea-Gif ended ahead of 2024.

He shared in his video that he was under a six-month contract with the network and waited until near the end of his contract to decide to leave the show.</p><p>Funky also explained he ended his six-month contract with Fox Soul after receiving the same pay for less work. The comedian claimed his pay dropped once Tea-Gif went from airing two nights to five days a week. Due to the extra work, Funky claimed he asked the network how much he would’ve made had the show stayed two nights a week.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After realizing the network “didn’t have or couldn’t find the money” he needed to remain on the show, and he “didn’t have or couldn’t find” to stay on the show, he decided it was best to quit.

Funky also publicly spat against Black women in the media, including Coach Stormy Wellington, who went viral in 2022 for slamming her friend’s “low vibrational” plate.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Funky’s takes didn’t always resonate with Black women and those who follow Tea-Gif. Before his exit from the series, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> circulated begging for Funky to be removed.

The influencer said that, while he doesn’t know who will replace him on the panel, the show has his full support, and he encouraged the show’s true fans — the “soulmates” — to follow his tune.</p><p>“I want you guys to continue, soulmates, supporting the show,” Funky said to the viewers. “I don’t know who will be appearing in my place. I don’t know anything.”</p><p>“I definitely wish the show the best,” he added. “Y’all continue to support whomever it is they choose to fill the seat with, and hopefully, those guys go on to make some magic.”</p><p>While Tea-Gif won’t be the same without Funky Dineva, we will surely see him on another platform soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aepaO4unnDoqWerpFiuaat1Z5kn6eoYsCwwctmq56Zl56z</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-funky-dineva-leave-fox-soul-teagif.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elliemae-millenkamp.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elliemae-millenkamp.html>Elliemae Millenkamp</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./phil-simmonds-coronation-street-actor-now.html>Who played Phil Simmonds in Coronation Street and where is he now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./phil-simmonds-coronation-street-actor-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

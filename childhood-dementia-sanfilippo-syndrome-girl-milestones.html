dementia, which has robbed her of her ability to walk, eat, talk and sing.</p><p>Her mum Ashley Haywood has shared the "heartbreaking reality" of watching her child fade away in front of her eyes - and knowing she'll probably outlive her.</p><p>"It’s the worst disease you’ve never heard of," she said.</p><p>When Ashley gave birth to her first child, she was overjoyed.</p><p>But sadly, this feeling didn't last as little Sadie Rae's breathing quickly started to deteriorate.</p><p>The tot was rushed to hospital and underwent several operations over the following three months.</p><p>She also had a shunt implanted in her brain as a result of a haemorrhage.</p><p>Ashley, 36, knew in her gut that something else was wrong so paid for further private testing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>This revealed Sadie had <a href=#>Sanfilippo Syndrome</a> - a rare gene defect that can affect growth and mental development.</p><p>Despite reaching many 'normal' childhood milestones, "it’s likely that my little girl will pass away before reaching adulthood," Ashley, a full-time carer, said.</p><p>"With this disease, I knew she would lose the ability to walk, talk, and feed herself in childhood – and forget everything she’d learned as a result of childhood dementia.</p><p>"Before she was two years old, she could say the ABCs, count to 10, and spell her name, and a year ago, she could speak in complete sentences.</p><p>"Now, we’re lucky if she says two words together."</p><p>Sadie, who loved to sing, has also forgotten the words to most of her favourite songs.</p><p>"She is also forgetting how to eat, so we have to remind her how to swallow," Ashley added.</p><p>"Despite this heartbreaking reality, we still make sure to find joy in the little moments."</p><p>It’s the worst disease you’ve never heard of.</p><span class=quote-credit>Ashley Haywood</span><p>The family, from <a href=#>North Carolina</a>, <a href=#>US</a>, only decided to get the test for <a href=#>Sanfilippo Syndrome</a> as a distant relative had also dealt with it.</p><p>They say they are sharing their battle to warn other parents of the symptoms, which have "shattered" their entire world.</p><p>"I knew she would suffer seizures and a host of other issues," Ashley said.</p><p>"We talked to doctors all over the world and travelled all over the US getting more information about potential clinical trials, but Sadie was not a candidate for any because of the brain haemorrhage and shunt.</p><p>"We had all the typical hopes and dreams for our baby girl, like her learning how to ride a bike, going to college and her dad walking her down the aisle.</p><p>"We quickly learned that none of that would be possible, and it was very hard to accept."</p><p>At three years old, Sadie was enrolled in clinical trials and for two years, she was thriving and healthy.</p><p>Sadly, this ended in April 2021 and no other company would fund the research due to the cost and lack of demand as the condition is so rare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

for Sadie, while campaigning for more effective treatments and raising awareness on social media in hopes for a cure.</p><p>The mum said: "We are hopeful that other trails will happen soon, and Sadie might get another chance.</p><p>"We’ve chosen to be more public with our lives than we ever imagined.</p><p>"Rare diseases often rely on funding from families to get research started, so we share Sadie's story to spread awareness and generate more research funding through the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation.</p><p>"We've accepted Sadie's disease, but we're still fighting for treatments.</p><p>"The older she gets, the harder it will be for treatments to help."</p><p>She added: "It will never get easier seeing Sadie lose the skills she worked so hard to gain, but she is incredibly resilient and she doesn't let her disease get her down.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"She has taught us, and many people online,

Syndrome?</h3></p><p>SANFILIPPO Syndrome - also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis type III or MPS III - is a rare neurodegenerative disease.</p><p>It causes children to lose all the skills they've gained (like talking and walking), suffer seizures and movement disorders, and experience pain.</p><p>Its symptoms, which worsen as kids get older, mean it is often described as causing childhood dementia or Alzheimer's.</p><p>Sanfilippo Syndrome is estimated to affect one in every 70,000 births.</p><p>It occurs in children born with a single genetic defect that causes their body to lack a necessary enzyme.</p><p>Symptoms, which also include speech and language delays, ear infections, headaches, sleep problems and hyperactivity, usually surface between the ages of one and six.</p><p>Sadly, it has a 100 per cent mortality rate, with sufferers typically passing away in their early teens.</p><p>There is currently no cure, but clinical trials for enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy are taking place.</p><p>Source: <a href=# aria-label="Cure Sanfilippo Foundation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cure Sanfilippo Foundation</a></p><p class=postsid

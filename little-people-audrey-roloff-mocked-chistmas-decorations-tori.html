Ick. Hope to never see this hodgepodge of [a] tree again."</p><h2>TORI'S TREE</h2><p>When it came time for an authentic tree, Tori and Zach went all out - <a href=#>finding and cutting down their own</a> holiday pine.</p><p>While fans applauded them for being far more subtle with their tree choice, they went big in other areas.</p><p>After <a href=#>Tori showed off their train set</a> under the tree, fans speculated that the star might be trying to outdo her sister-in-law.</p><p>Hours after Audrey posted a photo captioned "watching the train," that showed herself and Jeremy's middle child, two-year-old Bode, watching the toy train circle around the tree, Tori took to social media to share a similar post.</p><p>The next post from Audrey showed the train in motion as it traveled around gifts piled at the bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey explained: "<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@jeremyroloff</a>&nbsp;fixed the train he had growing up."</p><p>A few hours later,&nbsp;Tori shared several toy train posts of her own on Instagram.</p><p>First, she recorded her and Zach's sons Jackson and Josiah playing with the train set.</p><p>An excited Josiah repeatedly rant into the tracks with his walker unknowingly as Jackson hurried to fix the broken links.</p><p>Later in the Instagram Story, Jackson is shown expected the moving train as Tori captions the post: "Admiring his hard work."</p><p>The five-year-old was then seen acting as a bit of a dare-devil, placing his foot on the track just to move it away as the train sped past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/decor-drama-little-peoples-tori-784358213.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/little-helpers-little-peoples-tori-783983069.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/little-helpers-little-peoples-tori-783983072.jpg><p>Tori previously shared a series of photos that depicted the process of the family retrieving and setting up their&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;tree on her&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;Stories earlier this month.</p><p>The first showed her husband,&nbsp;Zach, and their son Jackson, five, smiling at the camera as the pair visited a local Christmas tree farm.</p><p>She captioned the post: "Sis and I (and Josiah) weren't up for tree hunting today but these boys got a good one!!"</p><p>The "Sis" Tori is referring to is of course her and Zach's middle child, daughter, Lilah, three.</p><p>The next post featured a Boomerang video of Jackson attempting the saw down their chosen pine tree.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>TLC</a>&nbsp;star explained: "Jackson helping cut her down!"</p><p>The third InstaStory entry showed the bundled tree inside the family's spacious living room.</p><p>Jackson, Lilah, and six-month-old Josiah are pictured in the background as they waited for the tree to be decorated.</p><p>A later video, captioned "Josiah supervising," shows the youngest Roloff watching his mother sweep stray pine needles from underneath the tree.</p><p>It's quickly followed up by a video of the <a href=#>fully decorated tree</a>.</p><p>Capturing the moment, Tori wrote: "I'm exhausted now. But it was worth it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/zach-roloff-takes-son-jackson-778673467-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/zach-tori-roloff-decorate-christmas-778673463.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/zach-tori-roloff-decorate-christmas-778673428-1.jpg><h2>HOLIDAY FAIL</h2><p>Audrey and Jeremy <a href=#>didn't seem to have as much luck</a>, as fans mocked them after their massive Christmas tree fail.</p><p>The married couple took to their respective Instagram's to show off their oversized Christmas tree, explaining their decision to go so big.</p><p>In&nbsp;Jeremy's&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram video</a>&nbsp;he shared with fans that he was figuring out how to fit the 16-foot tree into the family's new $2M farmhouse.</p><p>Jeremy and his wife&nbsp;Audrey decided to get a huge Christmas tree for their three children, Ember Jean, 5, Bode James, 2, and Radley Knight, 1.</p><p>"Well, as a lot of things go around here, we decided last minute to get a monster tree - because why not. The kids aren’t getting younger," Jeremy wrote in his Instagram video caption.</p><p>Once&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeremy and Audrey</a>&nbsp;decided to get the tree it then became Jeremy's mission to figure out how to get it set up in their home.</p><p>"We ended up with a 16ft’r and now I need to figure out how I’m going to manage a several hundred-pound tree and stand it up safely," Jeremy wrote.</p><h2>TOO MUCH TREE</h2><p>Many fans are unimpressed by the Roloff's Christmas tree and are poking fun at them for having such an enormous tree.</p><p>"Your kids aren't going to remember you got a 16 ft tree," one Reddit user wrote.</p><p>"They make everything so much more difficult than it has to be. Just get a normal size tree for the love of God."</p><p>Other fans insinuated that Audrey and Jeremy's Christmas tree choice was more about them than their kids.</p><p>"The kids are going to remember mom’s narcissism and how their parents made everything more difficult than it has to be," one person wrote.</p><p>Some fans even called out the&nbsp;Little People&nbsp;star couple for finding a tree that <a href=#>could pose a danger to their family</a>.</p><p>One critic wrote on Reddit: "So stupidddd. The kids are gonna end up getting hurt from that f**kin thing."</p><p>Another posted: "This is giving me anxiety knowing they have little kids running around, I hope they are careful about that."</p><p>A third urged the reality stars to take safety precautions, such as putting up a baby gate around the tree.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>They penned: "Everything about this is giving me major anxiety. It looks like it's going to fall over.</p><p>"They have 3 little kids. Please have them at least put a baby gate around it so the kids don't bump into it and take down the whole tree."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/tree-ly-scary-little-people-779221454-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/tree-ly-scary-little-people-779221458-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/pining-little-people-fans-mock-779025354.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/little-peoples-zach-roloff-takes-779776829-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/pining-little-people-fans-mock-779025023.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/tree-ly-scary-little-people-779221324.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaGaFc4GYaKOirKShsm68xKinpZ1dlsKlvsSyZKunnKSzp3nMqJqknZRisKm10q2kmqtdmbKku9Gaq6Knnqh6tbvRomY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flittle-people-audrey-roloff-mocked-chistmas-decorations-tori.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bruno-fernandes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bruno-fernandes.html>Bruno Fernandes: FIFA, Wife &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhobhs-brandi-glanville-says-she-collapsed-at-home-son-called-911.html>RHOBH's Brandi Glanville Says She 'Collapsed at Home,' Son Called 911</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhobhs-brandi-glanville-says-she-collapsed-at-home-son-called-911.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
